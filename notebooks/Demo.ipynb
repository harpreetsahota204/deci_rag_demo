       "[('SUPERCLOUD COMPOSER Your Infrastructure Gateway SuperCloud Composer is a composable cloud management platform that provides a unified dashboard to administer software-defined data centers. Supermicro’s cloud infrastructure management software brings speed, agility, and simplicity to IT administration by integrating data center tasks into a single intelligent management solution. Our hybrid approach allows traditional paradigm data centers to continue to support their existing operations while allowing their current workloads to have the flexibility to move to a disaggregated infrastructure model. Our robust composer engine can orchestrate cloud workloads through a streamlined Redfish API. SuperCloud Composer also monitors and manages the broad portfolio of multi-generation Supermicro servers and third-party systems through its data center lifecycle management feature set from a single unified console. 1 Key Benefits 2 Features 3 Hardware and Software Requirements 11 Virtual Machine Appliance 11 Supported Server Platforms 12 SuperCloud Composer License 12 Supermicro is a global leader in high performance, green computing server technology and innovation. We provide our global customers with application-optimized servers and workstations customized with blade, storage, and GPU solutions. Our products offer proven reliability, superior design, and one of the industry’s broadest array of product configurations, to fit all computational needs. 2 Today’s modern data centers face the growing need for operating efficiency through cost reduction in IT spending. Supermicro understands that IT organizations require a management platform to span multiple generations of infrastructure technology. IT managers are faced with the ever-rising cost of technology refresh and scale-out of systems due to Big Data. The Intel Data Center Group estimates resources are underutilized at rates of up to 45 %, and data center operating efficiency is only at 50 %. In addition, PUE costs are increasing, data center real estate square footage prices are on the rise, and manpower hour rates are climbing exponentially. In addition, Patrick Nelson from Network World (Reference 1 ) estimates in-house server capacity to be in the range of 20% to 50% even when you factor in virtualization gains. The traditional IT paradigm resulted in a cumbersome hardware provisioning process, with a fixed ratio of computing, storage, accelerator resources, and a lack of a one-size-fits-all platform capable of monitoring, telemetry, analytics, and intelligent system management. The new SuperCloud Composer embodies Supermicro’s approach to software-defined and composable cloud solutions for future data centers. This provides you some of the key benefits and features of SuperCloud Composer and system requirements and licensing details of the solution. Key Benefits of SuperCloud Composer • A single-pane-of-glass platform with a streamlined, intuitive management interface • A standardized Redfish Northbound API Message Bus for easy third-party software platform integration • A scalable management platform without adding unnecessary complexity • A unified dashboard that encompasses compute, storage, networking, and rack management • The ability to monitor and manage all elements of the resource pools in a Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure (CDI) • Inherently software-defined and automated in support of multi-tiered datacenter-to-edge cloud infrastructure management • Role-based access control to support modern data center security policies • Rich analytics, telemetry, and intelligent system lifecycle management • Parallel multi-system upgrade and configuration capability reducing hardware maintenance downtime 3 Features Intelligent Data Center Management Network Storage Disaggregated Infrastructure Composed Node Administration of Management Appliance Comprehensive system health monitoring and alerting Top-of-rack (TOR) Network Provisioning utilizing streamlined GUI wizards JBOF management Integration support for GigaIOTM PCIe Switch OS deployment in seconds utilizing fast-deploy (Centos, RHEL Ubuntu) Support for SNMP v2 and SNMP v3 Rack management Powerful network configurator wizard that creates network template build plans Storage fabric configurator wizard that creates storage template build plans for NVMe network fabrics JBOF management Repository to store golden images for fast-deploy deployments Change IP address/CIDR of SCC appliance Device discovery and deep discovery Robust network orchestrator that utilizes a REST API gateway to push network configuration build plans to infrastructure fabric Creation of storage integration support, including GigaIO Switch JBOG management Operating provisioning utilizing PXE boot (ESX 6.8, RHEL 7.5, Ubuntu 18.04, 16.04, 14.04, SUSE Enterprise Linux 15.1, and Centos 7) DNS Pod management utilizing POD View Switch sweeper Management support for ISCSI initiators and targets Allocation of GPUs from a resource pool utilizing GigaIO PCIe fabric Software inventory to manage Kickstart and ISO images for PXE deployment NTP BMC access Switch configuration detail Management support for NVMe initiators and targets Allocation of NVMe storage from a resource pool utilizing GigaIO PCIe fabric Support to send logs to a Syslog server iKVM console Interface status and counters RAID management and storage controller monitoring for Broadcom 3008 and 3108 Dynamic fabric topology discovery Streamlined installation configuration wizard that utilizes Ansible Playbooks UID management MAC address table Fabric configuration and reporting BIOS harvesting Zero-touch provisioning Fabric representation persistence & recovery Asset Tagging Analytics of thermal and power for JBOG resource box Physical asset collateral and collection JBOG physical asset collection FRU management Interface status and counters DMI GPU monitoring 4 Dashboard Dashboard is an information management tool to provide aggregated views of POD health, visualized system data analytics, activity event timeline tracking utilizing standardized icon footprints, providing the administrator at a glance awareness of data center operations. Administrators can click on each component within the dashboard to learn more detailed metadata about system status, composed node status, and allocated storage. POD View The Pod View’s rack management solution provides Data Center operatives the flexibility to organize their data center requirements based on common workloads assigned to a rack deployment either at the edge or physical appliances within a Data Center that are miles away. 5 Network SuperCloud Composer (SCC) enforces a network blueprint where it constructs VLANs to partition specific workloads from segmented broadcast domain traffic. SuperCloud Composer utilizes a rich feature called network provisioning. It pushes build plans to data switches either as single-thread or multi- thread operations where Composer updates multiple switches simultaneously by shared or unique build plan templates. Build plan templates for data switches are constructed by a Network Configurator Wizard in JSON format and pushed by a Network Orchestrator engine utilizing industry standardized API calls. During network management operation, SuperCloud Composer also offers a rich, intelligent network agent called switch sweeper to maintain configuration compliance between original build plans constructed by network configurator and operational build plans within switch dynamic memory. 6 Fast OS Deployment and Provisioning During the fast-deploy composition phase, architects execute a composed new node wizard where snapshots of OS images are composed with customized metadata that has been ingested within the OS image. The architect instructs this customized metadata when performing the creation of a user-defined build template. 7 Composed Node and GigaIOTM PCIe Switch Integration SuperCloud Composer delivers a software-defined model, leveraging pools of Composable Disaggregated resources across GigaIO’s PCIe switch fabric for low latency workloads Supermicro’s software framework enables Administrators to deploy collections of fluid resources (GPU, FPGA, and NVMe flash) utilizing an intuitive provisioning wizard within seconds. Each composed system can allocate resources on-demand across a scalable GigaIO FabreX fabric and then return resources back to the pool for other systems. 8 Composable Rack-Scale Infrastructure Integration with GigaIO FabreX TOR Switch to deliver NVMe-oF, DAS performance with NAS sharing, and GPUDirect RDMA to GPU systems or JBOGs. 9 JBOF Management SuperCloud Composer uplifts the JBOF management experience by exposing an intuitive drive map tool giving the end-user visualization of drive level presence. 10 Physical Asset Collateral The compute module is a collection of monitored hosts that have been successfully registered by administrators. It is important to note that monitored hosts cannot perform simple system management tasks unless data center operatives complete drawer configuration functions during POD View execution. SuperCloud Composer provides an inventory of fluid pools of compute to manage physical fabric resources individually without entering the BMC webUI, allowing administrators to drill down and look at the physical attributes of a system. 11 Hardware and Software Requirements Standalone Server SYS-1019P-WTR (SuperServer 1019P-WTR) HA Server Configuration 2 of SYS-1019P-WTR (SuperServer 1019P-WTR) Motherboard Super X11SPW-TF CPU Single Socket P (LGA 3647) (Intel Xeon Scalable Processor) Memory 256GB SSD Drive 2X 1TB SATA set to Raid 1 Operating System Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Browser Chrome, Firefox Virtual Machine Appliance Hypervisor Support Centos, RHEL, VMware ESX Anti-affinity Group virtual machines across different hypervisors CPU Requires one unit of CPU, 16 core count Memory 256GB SSD Drive RAID SAN configuration of 1TB Operating System Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Browser Chrome, Firefox Hypervisor Support Centos, RHEL, VMware ESX 12 Supported Server Platforms (as of September 23rd, 2020) AS -2124BT-HNTR SYS-1019P-WTR SYS-2029U-E1CR4 SYS-6019P-WT SYS-7049GP-TRT AS -2124BT-HTR SYS-1029GP-TR SYS-2029U-E1CR4T SYS-6019P-WTR SYS-F619P2-RC0 MBE-314E-420 SYS-1029GQ-TRT SYS-2029U-E1CR25M SYS-6019U-TN4RT SYS-F619P2-RC1 MBE-628E-822 SYS-1029GQ-TVRT SYS-2029U-E1CRT SYS-6019U-TR4 SYS-F619P2-RT MBE-628L-816 SYS-1029GQ-TXRT SYS-2029U-E1CRTP SYS-6019U-TR4T SYS-F619P2-RTN SBE-414E-422 SYS-1029P-N32R SYS-2029TP-HC1R SYS-6019U-TR25M SYS-F629P3-RC0B SBE-610J-822 SYS-1029P-WTRT SYS-2029TP-HTR SYS-6019U-TRT SYS-F629P3-RC1B SBE-614E-822 SYS-1029U-E1CR4 SYS-2029U-TN24R4T SYS-6019U-TRTP2 SYS-F629P3-RTB SBE-820C-820 SYS-1029U-E1CR4T SYS-2029U-TR4 SYS-6019U-TRTP SYS-F629P3-RTBN SSE-F3548 SYS-1029U-E1CR25M SYS-2029U-TR4T SYS-6029BT-DNC0R SSE-F3548S SYS-1029U-E1CRT SYS-2029U-TR25M SYS-6029BT-HNC0R SSE-F3548SR SYS-1029U-E1CRTP2 SYS-2029U-TRT SYS-6029P-WTR SSE-G3648B SYS-1029U-E1CRTP SYS-2029U-TRTP SYS-6029TP-HC0R SSE-G3648BR SYS-1029U-TN10RT SYS-2029UZ-TN20R25M SYS-6029TP-HTR SSG-136R-N32JBF SYS-1029U-TR4 SYS-4029GP-TRT2 SYS-6029U-E1CR4 SSG-6029P-E1CR12H SYS-1029U-TR4T SYS-4029GP-TRT3 SYS-6029U-E1CR4T SSG-6029P-E1CR12T SYS-1029U-TR25M SYS-4029GP-TRT SYS-6029U-E1CR25M SSG-6029P-E1CR16T SYS-1029U-TRT SYS-4029GP-TVRT SYS-6029U-E1CRT SSG-6049P-E1CR24H SYS-1029U-TRTP2 SYS-5019P-MR SYS-6029U-E1CRTP SSG-6049P-E1CR36H SYS-1029U-TRTP SYS-5019P-MT SYS-6029U-TNR SSG-6049P-E1CR60L+ SYS-1029UZ-TN20R25M SYS-5019P-WT SYS-6029U-TR4 SYS-1019D-16C-FHN13TP SYS-2029BT-HNC0R SYS-5019P-WTR SYS-6029U-TR4T SYS-2029BT-HNTR SYS-5019S-MT SYS-6029U-TR25M SYS-2029BT-HTR SYS-5029P-WTR SYS-6029U-TRT SYS-2029GP-TR SYS-6019P-MT SYS-6029U-TRTP Licensing Requirements for BMC advanced features BMC Data Center Product SKU: SFT-DCMS-Single Note: SuperCloud Composer (SCC) enforces licensing keys for advanced data center BMC licensing and SCC monitor node license.

       " 'text': 'SUPERCLOUD COMPOSER Your Infrastructure Gateway SuperCloud Composer is a composable cloud management platform that provides a unified dashboard to administer software-defined data centers. Supermicro’s cloud infrastructure management software brings speed, agility, and simplicity to IT administration by integrating data center tasks into a single intelligent management solution. Our hybrid approach allows traditional paradigm data centers to continue to support their existing operations while allowing their current workloads to have the flexibility to move to a disaggregated infrastructure model. Our robust composer engine can orchestrate cloud workloads through a streamlined Redfish API. SuperCloud Composer also monitors and manages the broad portfolio of multi-generation Supermicro servers and third-party systems through its data center lifecycle management feature set from a single unified console. 1 Key Benefits 2 Features 3 Hardware and Software Requirements 11 Virtual Machine Appliance 11 Supported Server Platforms 12 SuperCloud Composer License 12 Supermicro is a global leader in high performance, green computing server technology and innovation. We provide our global customers with application-optimized servers and workstations customized with blade, storage, and GPU solutions. Our products offer proven reliability, superior design, and one of the industry’s broadest array of product configurations, to fit all computational needs. 2 Today’s modern data centers face the growing need for operating efficiency through cost reduction in IT spending. Supermicro understands that IT organizations require a management platform to span multiple generations of infrastructure technology. IT managers are faced with the ever-rising cost of technology refresh and scale-out of systems due to Big Data. The Intel Data Center Group estimates resources are underutilized at rates of up to 45 %, and data center operating efficiency is only at 50 %. In addition, PUE costs are increasing, data center real estate square footage prices are on the rise, and manpower hour rates are climbing exponentially. In addition, Patrick Nelson from Network World (Reference 1 ) estimates in-house server capacity to be in the range of 20% to 50% even when you factor in virtualization gains. The traditional IT paradigm resulted in a cumbersome hardware provisioning process, with a fixed ratio of computing, storage, accelerator resources, and a lack of a one-size-fits-all platform capable of monitoring, telemetry, analytics, and intelligent system management. The new SuperCloud Composer embodies Supermicro’s approach to software-defined and composable cloud solutions for future data centers. This provides you some of the key benefits and features of SuperCloud Composer and system requirements and licensing details of the solution. Key Benefits of SuperCloud Composer • A single-pane-of-glass platform with a streamlined, intuitive management interface • A standardized Redfish Northbound API Message Bus for easy third-party software platform integration • A scalable management platform without adding unnecessary complexity • A unified dashboard that encompasses compute, storage, networking, and rack management • The ability to monitor and manage all elements of the resource pools in a Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure (CDI) • Inherently software-defined and automated in support of multi-tiered datacenter-to-edge cloud infrastructure management • Role-based access control to support modern data center security policies • Rich analytics, telemetry, and intelligent system lifecycle management • Parallel multi-system upgrade and configuration capability reducing hardware maintenance downtime 3 Features Intelligent Data Center Management Network Storage Disaggregated Infrastructure Composed Node Administration of Management Appliance Comprehensive system health monitoring and alerting Top-of-rack (TOR) Network Provisioning utilizing streamlined GUI wizards JBOF management Integration support for GigaIOTM PCIe Switch OS deployment in seconds utilizing fast-deploy (Centos, RHEL Ubuntu) Support for SNMP v2 and SNMP v3 Rack management Powerful network configurator wizard that creates network template build plans Storage fabric configurator wizard that creates storage template build plans for NVMe network fabrics JBOF management Repository to store golden images for fast-deploy deployments Change IP address/CIDR of SCC appliance Device discovery and deep discovery Robust network orchestrator that utilizes a REST API gateway to push network configuration build plans to infrastructure fabric Creation of storage integration support, including GigaIO Switch JBOG management Operating provisioning utilizing PXE boot (ESX 6.8, RHEL 7.5, Ubuntu 18.04, 16.04, 14.04, SUSE Enterprise Linux 15.1, and Centos 7) DNS Pod management utilizing POD View Switch sweeper Management support for ISCSI initiators and targets Allocation of GPUs from a resource pool utilizing GigaIO PCIe fabric Software inventory to manage Kickstart and ISO images for PXE deployment NTP BMC access Switch configuration detail Management support for NVMe initiators and targets Allocation of NVMe storage from a resource pool utilizing GigaIO PCIe fabric Support to send logs to a Syslog server iKVM console Interface status and counters RAID management and storage controller monitoring for Broadcom 3008 and 3108 Dynamic fabric topology discovery Streamlined installation configuration wizard that utilizes Ansible Playbooks UID management MAC address table Fabric configuration and reporting BIOS harvesting Zero-touch provisioning Fabric representation persistence & recovery Asset Tagging Analytics of thermal and power for JBOG resource box Physical asset collateral and collection JBOG physical asset collection FRU management Interface status and counters DMI GPU monitoring 4 Dashboard Dashboard is an information management tool to provide aggregated views of POD health, visualized system data analytics, activity event timeline tracking utilizing standardized icon footprints, providing the administrator at a glance awareness of data center operations. Administrators can click on each component within the dashboard to learn more detailed metadata about system status, composed node status, and allocated storage. POD View The Pod View’s rack management solution provides Data Center operatives the flexibility to organize their data center requirements based on common workloads assigned to a rack deployment either at the edge or physical appliances within a Data Center that are miles away. 5 Network SuperCloud Composer (SCC) enforces a network blueprint where it constructs VLANs to partition specific workloads from segmented broadcast domain traffic. SuperCloud Composer utilizes a rich feature called network provisioning. It pushes build plans to data switches either as single-thread or multi- thread operations where Composer updates multiple switches simultaneously by shared or unique build plan templates. Build plan templates for data switches are constructed by a Network Configurator Wizard in JSON format and pushed by a Network Orchestrator engine utilizing industry standardized API calls. During network management operation, SuperCloud Composer also offers a rich, intelligent network agent called switch sweeper to maintain configuration compliance between original build plans constructed by network configurator and operational build plans within switch dynamic memory. 6 Fast OS Deployment and Provisioning During the fast-deploy composition phase, architects execute a composed new node wizard where snapshots of OS images are composed with customized metadata that has been ingested within the OS image. The architect instructs this customized metadata when performing the creation of a user-defined build template. 7 Composed Node and GigaIOTM PCIe Switch Integration SuperCloud Composer delivers a software-defined model, leveraging pools of Composable Disaggregated resources across GigaIO’s PCIe switch fabric for low latency workloads Supermicro’s software framework enables Administrators to deploy collections of fluid resources (GPU, FPGA, and NVMe flash) utilizing an intuitive provisioning wizard within seconds. Each composed system can allocate resources on-demand across a scalable GigaIO FabreX fabric and then return resources back to the pool for other systems. 8 Composable Rack-Scale Infrastructure Integration with GigaIO FabreX TOR Switch to deliver NVMe-oF, DAS performance with NAS sharing, and GPUDirect RDMA to GPU systems or JBOGs. 9 JBOF Management SuperCloud Composer uplifts the JBOF management experience by exposing an intuitive drive map tool giving the end-user visualization of drive level presence. 10 Physical Asset Collateral The compute module is a collection of monitored hosts that have been successfully registered by administrators. It is important to note that monitored hosts cannot perform simple system management tasks unless data center operatives complete drawer configuration functions during POD View execution. SuperCloud Composer provides an inventory of fluid pools of compute to manage physical fabric resources individually without entering the BMC webUI, allowing administrators to drill down and look at the physical attributes of a system. 11 Hardware and Software Requirements Standalone Server SYS-1019P-WTR (SuperServer 1019P-WTR) HA Server Configuration 2 of SYS-1019P-WTR (SuperServer 1019P-WTR) Motherboard Super X11SPW-TF CPU Single Socket P (LGA 3647) (Intel Xeon Scalable Processor) Memory 256GB SSD Drive 2X 1TB SATA set to Raid 1 Operating System Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Browser Chrome, Firefox Virtual Machine Appliance Hypervisor Support Centos, RHEL, VMware ESX Anti-affinity Group virtual machines across different hypervisors CPU Requires one unit of CPU, 16 core count Memory 256GB SSD Drive RAID SAN configuration of 1TB Operating System Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Browser Chrome, Firefox Hypervisor Support Centos, RHEL, VMware ESX 12 Supported Server Platforms (as of September 23rd, 2020) AS -2124BT-HNTR SYS-1019P-WTR SYS-2029U-E1CR4 SYS-6019P-WT SYS-7049GP-TRT AS -2124BT-HTR SYS-1029GP-TR SYS-2029U-E1CR4T SYS-6019P-WTR SYS-F619P2-RC0 MBE-314E-420 SYS-1029GQ-TRT SYS-2029U-E1CR25M SYS-6019U-TN4RT SYS-F619P2-RC1 MBE-628E-822 SYS-1029GQ-TVRT SYS-2029U-E1CRT SYS-6019U-TR4 SYS-F619P2-RT MBE-628L-816 SYS-1029GQ-TXRT SYS-2029U-E1CRTP SYS-6019U-TR4T SYS-F619P2-RTN SBE-414E-422 SYS-1029P-N32R SYS-2029TP-HC1R SYS-6019U-TR25M SYS-F629P3-RC0B SBE-610J-822 SYS-1029P-WTRT SYS-2029TP-HTR SYS-6019U-TRT SYS-F629P3-RC1B SBE-614E-822 SYS-1029U-E1CR4 SYS-2029U-TN24R4T SYS-6019U-TRTP2 SYS-F629P3-RTB SBE-820C-820 SYS-1029U-E1CR4T SYS-2029U-TR4 SYS-6019U-TRTP SYS-F629P3-RTBN SSE-F3548 SYS-1029U-E1CR25M SYS-2029U-TR4T SYS-6029BT-DNC0R SSE-F3548S SYS-1029U-E1CRT SYS-2029U-TR25M SYS-6029BT-HNC0R SSE-F3548SR SYS-1029U-E1CRTP2 SYS-2029U-TRT SYS-6029P-WTR SSE-G3648B SYS-1029U-E1CRTP SYS-2029U-TRTP SYS-6029TP-HC0R SSE-G3648BR SYS-1029U-TN10RT SYS-2029UZ-TN20R25M SYS-6029TP-HTR SSG-136R-N32JBF SYS-1029U-TR4 SYS-4029GP-TRT2 SYS-6029U-E1CR4 SSG-6029P-E1CR12H SYS-1029U-TR4T SYS-4029GP-TRT3 SYS-6029U-E1CR4T SSG-6029P-E1CR12T SYS-1029U-TR25M SYS-4029GP-TRT SYS-6029U-E1CR25M SSG-6029P-E1CR16T SYS-1029U-TRT SYS-4029GP-TVRT SYS-6029U-E1CRT SSG-6049P-E1CR24H SYS-1029U-TRTP2 SYS-5019P-MR SYS-6029U-E1CRTP SSG-6049P-E1CR36H SYS-1029U-TRTP SYS-5019P-MT SYS-6029U-TNR SSG-6049P-E1CR60L+ SYS-1029UZ-TN20R25M SYS-5019P-WT SYS-6029U-TR4 SYS-1019D-16C-FHN13TP SYS-2029BT-HNC0R SYS-5019P-WTR SYS-6029U-TR4T SYS-2029BT-HNTR SYS-5019S-MT SYS-6029U-TR25M SYS-2029BT-HTR SYS-5029P-WTR SYS-6029U-TRT SYS-2029GP-TR SYS-6019P-MT SYS-6029U-TRTP Licensing Requirements for BMC advanced features BMC Data Center Product SKU: SFT-DCMS-Single Note: SuperCloud Composer (SCC) enforces licensing keys for advanced data center BMC licensing and SCC monitor node license.
