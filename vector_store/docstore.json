TPC-C consists of a set of basic operations that exercise system functionalities in a complex OLTP environment. TPC-C benchmark provides a representative wholesale supplier with several geographically distributed sales districts and associated warehouses to model an order fulfillment system where the database receives requests for data, adds new data, and makes multiple changes to the data from a large number of users. The primary metrics are: \u2022 Transactions per minute (expressed as tpmC). Introduction 1 World Record Performance 2 System Under Test (SUT) 2 Cluster Configuration 3 Benchmark Workload 3 High Per-Core Performance 3 Results 4 Conclusions 4 Footnotes 5 Additional Resources 5 \u2022 The associated price per transaction (expressed as $/tpmC). The tpmC metric measures how many New-Order transactions per minute a system generates while executing business transactions under specific user response time requirements. World Record Performance Independent testing performed by Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA)2 yielded a world-record performance of 507,802 tpmC on Supermicro A+ Server 1124US-TNRP servers powered by 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors, which is ~33% faster compared to 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processor- based server1.

This reference architecture enables you to swiftly add direct-attached NVMe storage capacity to your GPU server, as one single pool of storage without performance penalty. Supermicro SuperServer Storage Appliances Deliver Elastic NVMe for AI Workloads 2 NVMESH BIGTWIN DIRECT-ATTACHED REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE SPECS Supermicro has been a leader in introducing NVMe support and advanced NVMe features in our product portfolio and BigTwin continues that tradition. BigTwin supports 24 hot-swappable 2.5\u201d U.2 NVMe drives, or mixed configurations with SAS3 and SATA3 drives (varies by different BigTwin models). The key benefit of BigTwin is the no-compromise design. Historically multi-node systems traded off features and capacity for higher density. They were deployed for workloads that did not require the highest performance or the highest memory density on a single node. The new 2U BigTwin design is a breakthrough multi-node system that supports the highest performing CPUs, full 24 DIMMs of memory and up to 24 all-flash NVMe SSD drives. This NVMesh direct-attached Elastic NVMe GPU storage reference architecture leverages the Supermicro BigTwinTM architecture, featuring a 2U 4-node system that delivers the highest performance and efficiency per rack unit.

As data sets continue to grow exponentially, processing massive volumes of data at high speed has become one of the major challenges for modern data centers. GPUs have become the go-to compute resources behind AI workloads, and NVMe flash has become the standard for high-performance, low-latency storage. By providing GPUs with direct access to an elastic pool of NVMe, AI data scientists and HPC researchers can feed far more data to the applications \u2013 they no longer face data bottlenecks and can get to better results faster.

To enable the broadest set of virtualized applications, servers are being built with the maximum possible memory, limited only by the physical PCB real estate.

The problem: This results in a massive slowdown. It could be up to 125x slower, even using the fastest SSDs. The outcome: A 4- hour job running in SWAP could take more than 20 days to complete, rendering certain workloads impractical. A common workaround is to rewrite the application to process the data in manageable chunks and then assemble the result. But this approach is fraught with numerous problems as it is error prone, creates developer costs, and may not solve the run time issues. What is needed is a way to improve direct access to offboard memory by providing on-demand access to memory across servers. The industry has recognized this and has been working on a software-defined memory solution for many years in the form of CXL. However, CXL 3.0, which provides complete caching capability, is still several years away, will require new server architecture, and will only be available in forthcoming generations of hardware. What We Need is a Better Software-Defined Memory Workloads at the heart of everything from HPC to AI have significant memory requirements. But designers struggle to make use of the additional cores available in modern CPUs. The leap forward in the number of CPU cores is mismatched with a lack of memory bandwidth. And it continues to worsen due to the limited physical space to incorporate more memory and the limited access to additional memory beyond the motherboard. Concerns about latency compromises are surfacing, too. Even CXL 3.0 is still piggybacking on the PCI Express (PCIe) physical layer and relying on physical memory paired with PCIe, so one would ordinarily incur a penalty on a key critical metric\u2014latency. Generally, the farther the memory is from the CPU, the higher the latency and the poorer the performance. To embrace scaling, memory must be moved outside of the server.

Welcome to Kove:SDM \u2013 The Software-Defined Memory Solution Your days of memory limitations are over. Kove:SDM is a breakthrough technology that gives enterprises the memory size and performance they need when and where they need it on any hardware. It empowers individual servers to draw from a shared memory pool, including amounts far larger than could be contained within any physical server, so each job receives exactly the memory it needs while reducing your power consumption. With Kove:SDM, for instance, you can allocate 10x 64 GiB for ten containers on a compute node with only 64 GiB of memory, create containers with larger memory than the physical hypervisor, or burst to allocate 40 TiB to a single server for an hour. Control memory in real-time, on-demand, using easy-to-configure provisioning rules. Memory capacity scales up to CPU addressable limits beyond the limits of local physical DIMM slots. Kove:SDM solves memory stranding by pooling memory into a global resource, shareable and reusable across the data center. In other words, it decouples or \u201cdisaggregates\u201d memory from standard servers, aggregating memory into a shared memory pool resource. SDM policies then structure the access to the memory pool. After use, Kove:SDM securely zeros out and returns memory to the pool for reuse. As a result, Kove:SDM also provides strong security against attacks targeting memory penetration. Kove:SDM Works with Any Server Unlike CXL, no special chips or hardware are required to run Kove:SDM. Rather, it decouples memory from servers, pooling memory into an aggregate, provisionable, and distributable resource across the data center using unmodified Supermicro hardware. Like a Storage Area Network (SAN) provisioning storage using policies, Kove:SDM delivers a RAM Area Network (RAN) that provisions memory using policies. Both provide a global, on-demand resource exactly where, when, and how it is needed. For example, an organization might: \u2022 Use a Kove:SDM policy to allocate up to 2 TiB of need-based memory for any of 200 servers between 5 pm-8:30 pm; \u2022 Develop a provisioning rule that would provision a virtual machine with larger memory than the physical hypervisor, such", "start_char_idx": 4554, "end_char_idx": 6808, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c5e6a9f-cf59-44c5-a2ab-4d24deb05060": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c5e6a9f-cf59-44c5-a2ab-4d24deb05060", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Solution_Brief_KoveSDM.pdf", "publication_date": "August 2023", "referenced_websites": [], "section_summary": "The section discusses Supermicro's Kove:SDM solution, which is a transparent software that orchestrates memory pool usage and enables technology leaders and their enterprises to maximize the performance of their infrastructure and people.

In total, the tests were executed with 16 scenarios, each repeated seven times to ensure accurate data collection across 2.165 quadrillion results averaged. This proof of concept validated the seamless compatibility of Kove:SDM and Red Hat OpenShift in handling containerized workloads. Additionally, the test demonstrated the significant benefits offered by Kove:SDM in scenarios where workloads require memory capacities exceeding physical limitations while exhibiting minimal to no performance penalty. Benchmark Results Combined with Intel CPU governor settings, Kove:SDM provided 12 to 54% power savings, illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 3 Power Savings with Kove:SDM Conclusion Kove:SDM is fully integrated with Red Hat OpenShift. The Supermicro BigTwin multi-node is the ideal and most reliable minimal Red Hat cluster. The Supermicro BigTwin system is very well adopted across industries, given its density and versatility, and is suited to broad applications. With the Supermicro BigTwin deployments, many nodes are typically concentrated in a single cloud instance. Many of these nodes will have spare available memory. Kove:SDM allows memory in nearby nodes to be dynamically allocated to a single Supermicro BigTwin node enabling it to perform very large in-memory workloads well over the memory capacity of a single node. The testing shows that memory can be dynamically and transparently assigned to a workload by Kove:SDM. The latency of memory across nodes is negligible compared to traditional memory management methods enabling applications that would otherwise be impractical given very long run times without Kove:SDM.

Being experienced with massive scale deployments, we saw the limitations of large installations' file system performance scalability. As storage media had evolved over the years with SSD technologies, these limitations came mainly from the filesystem software stack rather than limited storage media technology. The fundamental limitations of the legacy storage software stack became even more apparent later when much faster Non-Volatile Memory technologies appeared in the market. There were several bottlenecks in the legacy software stack, but the most prominent of these are the POSIX interface and block-based IO. To ensure data consistency, the definition of the POSIX interface requires pessimistic locking, proactively locking in any situation where a conflict might occur. Imagine if tens of thousands of clients were writing to the same file and the amount of serialization that would arise if locking occurred on every relevant operation, even if none of these writes would generate a conflict? This pessimistic approach just does not scale, so it became necessary to consider other ways to provide data consistency to unlock the filesystem for scalability.

Again, this could not be solved with software alone but needed a change with both software and storage media to overcome. The work resulted in developing a fundamentally new software stack called DAOS (Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage) based on the new platform technologies to leverage persistent memory and NVMe SSD capabilities and ground up software development without legacy design overhead. DAOS Overview DAOS (Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage) software stack is designed from the ground up for performance, combining persistent memory and NVMe SSDs with direct access through the Persistent Memory Development Kit and the Storage Performance Development Kit user space libraries to interface to the media directly, and provides a high efficiency software stack with rich functionality over RDMA-enabled fabric. DAOS engine can be described as a highly efficient, highly performant object store. Data stored in KV format efficiently balances between PMEM and NVMe tiers for the most advantage of access time, IOPS, and bandwidth. Moreover, users can interface to various datasets (DAOS Containers) using corresponding middleware, which provides compatibility with existing applications and innovative capabilities.

DAOS Software Eco-system Figure 1 - DAOS Software Ecosystem Supermicro Hardware and Intel DAOS Supermicro 3 DAOS Storage Server Hardware Design Architecture Intel Optane Persistent Memory (PMem) is a fundamental technology that DAOS builds upon. Unlike SSDs, Intel Optane Persistent Memory offers low latency byte-granular access, which means that applications can now access small pieces of data in parallel, free from the locking required by blocks. DAOS takes advantage of this by storing two different data types in the persistent memory \u2013 metadata and small I/Os, which the DAOS policy engine defines. This allows it to optimize bulk data writes to NVMe SSDs for better SSD performance where larger block size delivers better bandwidth and SSD endurance which is dependent on the write pattern. In addition, this enables customers to use less expensive SSDs, such as moving from high- endurance SSDs to mid-endurance or standard-endurance drives or even moving between technologies such as TLC-based NAND SSDs to QLC SSDs.

This allows DAOS, via PMDK, to eliminate a point of synchronization and deliver more IOPs on writes. Finally, the current server platform has a better I/O subsystem by introducing PCIe Gen4 support with 64 lanes per socket.

For example, if the target DAOS server capacity is 34TB and Intel SSD D7-P5510 Series 7.68TB selected, the table above clearly illustrates a potential underperforming problem. According to this corner case, only 5 SSDs are required to reach the capacity point, while not enough to drive the full dual HDR200 bandwidth (P5510 is 7GB/s SR and 4.2GB/s SW). In such examples, 10 x 3.84TB drives should be considered instead. Generally, 3D NAND TLC based standard endurance SSDs are the default choice for DAOS configuration. However, PMEM protects the endurance of SSDs in front by handling small I/O, so SSD writes are always optimal and aligned. This gradually improves SSD endurance and even allows DAOS implementations using QLC NAND technology. For more details, read that Intel whitepaper in the link section below.

It\u2019s pretty common in HPC to see parallel access to many files opening for reads, writes, attribute updates, creation, or deletion, so the IO500 subsets test this. As a result, metadata performance can create a significant bottleneck in the file system performance and is weighted heavily in the IO500 total score. DAOS has strong metadata performance as locking is minimized within DAOS. IOR measures throughput performance.

The design philosophy behind the Weka file system \u2013 WekaFS - was to create a single storage architecture that runs on-premises or in the public cloud with the performance of all-flash arrays, the simplicity and feature set of network-attached storage (NAS), and the scalability and economics of object storage. WEKA Solution Architecture Overview Figure 1 - Weka File System Structure Weka's file system (WekaFS) is a fully distributed, parallel file system that was written entirely from scratch to deliver the highest performance file and object services by leveraging NVMe flash as its primary storage for persistent data across a wide range of applications. WekaFS will also, transparent to the application layer, seamlessly expand the filesystem namespace to include an extended layer built on any S3 compliant object storage system (see Figure 3 and Figure 4 for more details). There is no need for data migration software or complex scripts; all data resides in a single global namespace for easy access and management while maintaining the best performance. The intuitive graphical user interface allows a single administrator to quickly and easily manage hundreds of petabytes of data without any specialized storage training. Weka's software delivers a more powerful and straightforward solution that would have traditionally required several disparate storage systems to leverage existing technologies in new ways and augment them with engineering innovations. The resulting software solution provides high performance for all workloads (big and small files, reads and writes, random, sequential, and metadata heavy). Furthermore, it is designed to run on a server infrastructure that does not rely on specialized hardware assist. As future hardware innovations come to market, WekaFS is well-positioned to leverage emerging technologies for the continued delivery of best cost and performance. The system can be expanded online to handle more demanding performance or store more capacity with no service interruption. 3 Supermicro WEKAIO Reference Architecture Configuration In 2018, WekaIO set a number of benchmark records using the previous generation 2U 4-Node X11 BigTwin 1.

These results were limited by the number of clients in the test. The Weka storage cluster is capable of significantly more performance in this configuration but will require more clients to drive that performance. The eight host X12 BigTwin cluster, with two SYS-220BT-HNTR systems, is estimated to have similar performance to the six host cluster with three SYS-220BT-DNTR systems. With the same number of clients, the six host cluster will have slightly more throughput and slightly fewer IOPS at the limit when more clients are added.

Altiostar/Supermicro O-RAN Solution 5G NR Distributed Unit (DU) Solution Based on O-RAN 5G is disrupting the mobile telecom network. To realize eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC, the top three use cases for 5G, mobile operators have to redesign their networks. Supermicro and Altiostar are leading the way to provide state-of-the-art platforms running best-in-class software infrastructure to ease the ability to deploy, manage, and orchestrate the mobile network. Solving the Challenges of 5G Networks One major change in 5G is the New Radio (NR). It will use much higher radio frequencies to achieve higher bandwidth required for the huge increase in connected devices and new use cases. Since higher frequencies will have shorter transmission range, more base stations will be required to cover existing areas. On top of this challenge, suppliers for Radio Area Network (RAN) equipment have been limited to a handful of large internation- al companies with proprietary solutions. Mobile network evolution has been slow while many innovations have happened with Internet and Cloud software. Service providers are migrating to open architecture-based RAN solutions for the transition to the 5G era. An open, cloud-native RAN concept has quickly gathered lots of interest and top global operators have formed the O-RAN alliance. O-RAN\u2019s mission is to build a new 5G RAN on a foundation of virtualized network elements, white-box hardware, and standard- ized interfaces that fully embrace O-RAN\u2019s core principles of intelligence and openness. As a contributing member of O-RAN, Supermicro is fully committed to contribute and deliver this solution. Altiostar is a software vendor that provides 5G-ready virtualized RAN solutions supporting open interfaces and a disaggregated hardware/software solution to build a multi-vendor web-scale network. Altiostar\u2019s OpenRAN software suite with open interfaces provides a high degree of programmability and automation. The combination of Altiostar\u2019s open software platform and Supermicro\u2019s commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) edge servers provides a reliable, flexible, scalable, and cost-compatible solution to realize the new RAN.

RAN cloudification is one of the fundamental tenets of the O-RAN architecture. The operators\u2019 NFV and virtual infrastructure manager (VIM) requirements enhance virtualization platforms in support of various functional splits from 3GPP. The RAN DU sits between the Remote Radio Unit (RRU) and the Central Unit (CU) and includes real-time L2 functions, baseband processing, and radio frequency processing. Currently, Supermicro\u2019s Xeon D-based 1019D-FHN13TP server is being proposed in a draft configuration for the DU in O-RAN\u2019s white box working group. In this configuration, the DU will support 3 sectors of RRUs via a RIM card from Altiostar. The RIM card will provide CPRI-to-eCPRI conversion so that the baseband and radio frequency information can be transmitted over the IP network. In Figure 5, the DU will support 12 sectors of RRUs with multiple LTE bands, requiring a large amount of digital signal processing in real time to perform the CPRI-to-eCPRI conversion. This task can be offloaded to an FPGA card, specifically the Intel\uf0d2 FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N3000.

Memory Machine takes ZeroIO In- memory snapshots so that if an application instance encounters a problem, it can be restarted from any valid snapshot. Some analytical pipelines take a long time to complete because there is no easy way to parallelize some stages. Memory Machine can create an AppCapsule \u2014 all the in-memory state and data associated with a running application instance (including open files residing on SSD). AppCapsule can be used to instantiate additional application instances. Consecutive 4 pipeline stages that can be parallelized can be started simultaneously without requiring any storage I/O. Note: the degree of parallelization that can be achieved depends on the analytical pipeline and the dataset. Some applications cannot run because there is insufficient memory (e.g., bioinformatics pipelines with large datasets). Other applications take a long time to execute because of limited memory \u2014 datasets must be processed in batches. Intel Optane Persistent Memory (PMem) provides high-capacity memory but is not straightforward to use. Using Memory Machine, applications can access all the memory capacity (DRAM+PMem) without requiring code changes. Note: when used in Intel Memory Mode, the DRAM portion is unavailable to the application. Case Study - Big Memory Accelerates Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Working with a leader in Single Cell RNA Sequencing and Analytics, Analytical Biosciences, the big memory data science workbench can dramatically increase the productivity of the genomic computation pipeline. Using snaps instead of storage IO, the data loading time for every stage is significantly reduced, up to 800X for some stages. It can save the overall execution time by at least 60% and delivers higher productivity by allowing data scientists to roll back and branch to perform what-if analysis.

Supermicro has partnered with Intel and SAP to certify Intel Optane DC persistent memory for use with SAP HANA version 2.0 SPS03, or higher, on 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors. Intel Optane DC persistent memory is an innovative memory technology that delivers affordable large capacity uniquely combined with support for data persistence. Data persistence technology allows for your entire data volume to reside on high speed Intel Optane DC persistent memory across work sessions and power downs without the need to write and read from a traditional disk. As validated by SAP and Intel, SAP HANA reboot time using a 6TB database was dramatically reduced from over 50 minutes down to 4 minutes\u2014a 12.5x improvement over traditional SSD to DDR load times. This makes Intel Optane DC persistent memory ideal for your SAP DevOps environment, where system restarts are frequently required. In addition to fast load times for DevOps, Intel Optane DC persistent memory delivers an optimized balance between persistence and performance at a lower cost per Gigabyte than DRAM. With the high cost of DDR, especially for large in-memory deployments, the use of Intel Optane DC persistent memory can dramatically lower the initial acquisition cost of your SAP HANA hardware. This cost savings increases exponentially as your SAP HANA cluster grows from system to rack scale. Intel Optane DC persistent memory is not only lower cost than DDR memory, but is also available in larger sizes, up to 512GB per unit. The combination of DDR memory plus Intel Optane DC persistent memory allows for much larger SAP HANA deployments, per socket, than use of traditional DDR memory alone (see graphic below). Please contact sapexpert@supermicro.com or your local Supermicro sales for up to date pricing and cost reduction comparison between Intel Optane DC persistent memory and DDR memory.

Oracle Processor Licensing is calculated by multiplying the total number of cores on each processor by a licensing factor defined by the Oracle Processor Core Factor Table. In addition to the Core license, Oracle typically charges an additional 20% for service & maintenance. With this license model, customers can reduce license costs by selecting low core count CPUs with the highest frequencies, such as the AMD EPYC 7F52 and 7F72. Oracle Database Standard Edition licensing is based on a per-socket license model. For multi-CPU servers, such as dual and quad-socket systems, Oracle Database Standard Edition requires an individual license for each socket in the system. This makes the Supermicro AS-1014S-WTRT an ideal cost-optimized solution for small to mid-size Oracle Database deployments with linear CPU scaling. 8 APPENDIX A \u2013 Oracle Linux Configuration The recommended way to configure Oracle Linux for Oracle Database is by installing the Oracle Preinstallation RPM.

Local Law 97, the centerpiece of 2019\u2019s Climate Mobilization Act, calls for carbon footprint reductions of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050, affecting more than 50,000 buildings in NYC. Not meeting these strict greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards will result in penalties of $268 per metric ton of CO2 over the mandated limits.

What is the Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) one should put in place, and what are the lowest hanging fruits for kWh Harvesting? To successfully implement a reliable and efficient energy management infrastructure, organizations need to address energy usage and the changing electric grid, requiring a \u201cnext level of energy efficiency\u201d to mobilize energy savings beyond historical practice. The five most significant challenges to address are: 1. The amount of energy savings must increase dramatically. 2. Energy efficiency sources and savings must be diversified. 3. Robust Measurement and Verification (M&V) for energy savings must be common. 4. Energy efficiency savings must be integrated with a carbon reduction framework. 5.

German IT services and consulting company, T-Systems T-Systems Edge Platform Delivers Low Latency with Supermicro Founded in 2000, T-Systems is a German global IT services and consulting company. It is a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, one of the world's leading integrated telecommunications companies with more than 184 million mobile customers across 50 countries. T-Systems recently unveiled EdgAIR, an Edge Computing platform that delivers low latency for IoT applications at enterprise facilities. Edge Computing brings computation and data storage closer to the location where the data is generated in order to reduce latency, maintain network reliability, save bandwidth and comply with data security regulations. This enables companies to use innovative, real-time applications in production, logistics and retail, and includes automated, guided vehicles and augmented and full virtual reality. The EdgAIR platform works directly on-site, which means that the data is not sent via a central computer center or Cloud. Supermicro offers a range of highly-configurable and powerful servers optimized for Intelligent Edge computing, and is working with T-Systems to develop an EdgAIR solution. Challenges As a leading provider of mobile and internet services to its customer base, T-Systems delivers content via an extensive network with a carrier-grade reliability environment - 99.9999%, which means less than 3 seconds of downtime per month. Achieving this reliability standard while providing critical connectivity and applications requires significant investments in capital and network management. As 5G ramps up globally, T-Systems is challenged to deliver not just high-speed services and applications, but also support a larger number of devices that attach to the network.

Content Creation Components Supermicro servers with 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors offer an optimized solution for creative organizations that need VDI, Rendering, and fast storage to create immersive experiences and engaging content. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): VDI is a desktop virtualization technology that separates the desktop environment and associated application software from the physical client device used to access it. This IT architecture means the desktop environment and applications are hosted on a central server and delivered to users' devices over a network. A VDI environment can increase employee access security, 1 Content Creation Components 1 Supermicro Solutions for VDI, Rendering, and Storage 2 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors are Ideal for M&E Workloads . 4 Summary 4 2 reduce IT costs, and increase collaboration. In addition, employees can access their desktops with the needed applications from different devices without being physically tied to a single device. However, these benefits require the right servers to process requests, securely store data, and maintain SLAs. Rendering: The rendering process, whether for computer generated imagery or to enhance or modify live action video, requires high performance servers that can modify the digital image at high resolutions. With videos being viewed at 60 frames/second, tremendous processing power is necessary to create or modify each frame for a seamless experience. The servers used for rendering must contain more than just a fast CPU but require large amounts of memory, GPUs, fast storage access, and networking to keep the CPUs and GPUs busy, which reduces the Total Cost of Ownership.

This 1:1 coupling between designer and workstation has limited scalability and made remote work difficult. NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise changes the 3D design scalability and remote work equation. It enables collaboration for creative teams on enterprise 3D visualization projects like never before. This new technology reduces costs and waste by enabling a simultaneous workflow, maximizes creativity by allowing new iterations without opportunity cost, and accelerates time to production by eliminating import-export workflows. Highlights of the Omniverse architecture: \u2022 Rendering builds on advanced NVIDIA RTX accelerated real-time ray-tracing technology and adds dynamic allocation of graphics processing unit (GPU) cores, even from separate machines, for rendering jobs. \u2022 Collaborative scene composition is enabled by Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD), an extensible, open- source file framework that allows the interchange of 3D assets. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus database and collaboration engine manage data such as geometry, lights, materials, textures, and more for defining a virtual \"world\" in and around a design, including its environment. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse Connect allows 3rd party client applications access to the Nucleus database using publish- subscribe messaging, letting many designers author live changes that everyone connected sees in real-time. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse Kit is a toolkit for lightweight plugins building applications and microservices. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse Create enables world-building, using advanced USD workflows such as layers, variants, instancing, animation caches, and more. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse View lets non-technical users review 3D content interactively in full, photorealistic fidelity. Using Supermicro hardware platforms, 3D design teams can select a hardware topology and mix and match configurations for an Omniverse Enterprise solution best fitting their needs. For example, \"creators\" can tap into the full capability needed for design, while \"reviewers\" can run on lighter hardware platforms at a reduced software licensing cost.

A test database was created on the MongoDB application consisting of three hundred million records and synthetic tests run through Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) software. One database test was conducted where a workload of two billion operations (50% reads and 50% updates) was run against the NoSQL MongoDB database. A 50% read/50% update workload is reasonably standard for database applications. This test measured four metrics: Run Time, Average Read, Latency, Average Update Latency, and Operations Throughput. The Supermicro Petascale storage server CPUs are PCIe 3.1-capable, so the XD6 Series SSD was tested at PCIe Gen3 speed.

This measurement is heavily dependent on factors such as database size. As databases become larger, the amount of time it takes to perform a read operation successfully can increase as the system has to query the database and find all of the data it needs through the vast records stored in the database. For update operations, the system needs to traverse the entire database of records until it finds the record that needs to be updated and then performs the necessary changes to the data. The low latency and high performance that the SSD provides enable the database to retrieve the records quickly from the SSD, which is critical in reducing the time it takes for each individual update to complete. With a database consisting of three hundred million records, the system took 18.33 hours to complete two billion operations within the database workload.

In order to meet critical business objectives, IT teams need to look for new ways to transform their data centers to achieve optimal performance. Unfortunately, IT teams do not always have the time or resources to evaluate, select and purchase the necessary hardware and software components. To meet this challenge, Supermicro, a global data center solution provider, has partnered with Intel to offer a solution that addresses these customer pain points. The solution is based on the Ultra SuperServer System which belongs to the well accomplished flagship line of SuperServers. This Ultra SuperServer Platform provides the critical building block foundation base needed for uncompromised compute and storage performance demanded by the hyper-converged and next generation software defined data center environments. Supermicro Intel Select Solutions for VMware vSAN 2 HYPER CONVERGENCE SOLUTION FOR ENTERPRISE AND SMBS Supermicro\u2019s Intel Select Solutions for VMware vSAN is certified for VMware vSAN ReadyNode and tightly specified by Intel and VMware to deliver out-of-the-box high performance. IT teams can be rest assured that their solutions are already verified for balance and optimized performance \u2013 from the hardware up through the firmware stack to the VMware vSAN software so they can get right to work meeting the SLA\u2019s of their applications rather than wading through multiple component options or conducting extensive system level testing prior to deployment. In addition to fast load times for HANA database, Intel Optane DC persistent memory delivers an optimized balance between persistence and performance at a lower cost per Gigabyte than DRAM. For large in-memory deployments, the use of Intel Optane DC persistent memory can dramatically lower the initial acquisition cost of your SAP HANA hardware.

Intel Select Solutions are verified hardware and software stacks that are optimized for specific software workloads and are designed to be easy to deploy. Easing Adoption of SD-WAN Current generation network equipment is based on purpose-built proprietary hardware. These appliances are single function boxes that are complex to maintain as well as slow and expensive to upgrade. They inhibit network platform suppliers from dynamically offering new network services and functions. Adapting Supermicro\u2019s uCPE can help network service providers take advantage of technology innovation in software-defined networking (SDN) and NFV, which are complementary but increasingly co-dependent if the benefits of software-defined networking are to be fully realized. A network service provider with Supermicro\u2019s uCPE could run multiple VNFs\u2014such as a router, VPN, and a firewall\u2014on a general- purpose server based on end-user demand. They have the flexibility to deploy new network functions and services without deploying new hardware servers, allowing significant CAPEX & OPEX reduction as well as increased speed and ease in the deployment of new services. Supermicro\u2019s verified Intel Select Solutions for uCPE are designed and tested to enable easy integration with a variety of VNFs, including SD-WAN (software defined- WAN).

With this innovation, SD-WAN is able to deliver increased network agility and cost reduction compared to traditional WANs. Instead of manually configuring and managing all WAN devices, including those at remote locations, SD-WAN overlay architecture enables you to centrally manage WAN infrastructure through a single interface. A hybrid approach to WAN infrastructure in both MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) & SD-WAN will increase the variety and complexity of performance issues. The market still has serious challenges to address such as: 1. Is it better to adopt a fully managed SD-WAN or should control be preserved in- house? 2. Is there a middle-ground that alleviates much of the day-to-day burdens without risking availability or data integrity? 3. Will adopting a hybrid approach cause a bottleneck retrieving data from remote network locations back to headquarters? Supermicro\u2019s verified Intel Select Solutions for uCPE address these challenges to adopting SD-WAN by providing an integrated hardware and software platform, with verified performance, to ease decision making and speed deployments.

An O-RAN network enables service providers to use components from many vendors, encouraging innovations and lowering costs. In addition, by using industry-standard servers, Open RAN can quickly borrow innovations from other parts of the IT world and apply them to the wireless network edge, thus increasing RAN's performance and flexibility and bringing many applications from the cloud to the edge. Key Components An Open RAN solution for a telco environment consists of Distributed Units (DU) and Centralized Units (CU) for compute purposes. The DUs and CU perform different tasks and can be specified as different types of optimized servers. \u2022 Distributed Unit \u2013 The Open Distributed Unit (O-DU) sits close to, or even at, the Radio Unit (RU), which broadcasts the mobile network signal and processes data transmission between the RU and the CU. Hardware used for the O-DU task often is commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) edge servers that can function as a baseband processing unit to handle high PHY layer, MAC, and RLC layer with network function virtualization (NFV) or Containers. \u2022 Central Unit \u2013 The Open Centralized Unit (O-CU) sits between the core network and a series of Distributed Units. The Centralized Unit collects the relevant data from the Distributed Units and sends that data to the core data center. The overall architecture of a 5G Telco network is described below. In RAN, the DU, CU, MEC/RIC, and edge servers are all", "start_char_idx": 1706, "end_char_idx": 3428, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f02923c5-438c-4077-a361-11a4c15a5a94": {"__data__": {"id_": "f02923c5-438c-4077-a361-11a4c15a5a94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Solution-Brief_Rakuten_Symphony.pdf", "publication_date": "March 2023", "referenced_websites": ["https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/system/iot/2u/sys-211e-31d)", "https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/system/iot/1u/sys-111e-fdwtr)", "www.supermicro.com/x13", "https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/system/Hyper/2U/SYS-221H-TNR?mlg=0)", "https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/system/iot/2u/sys-221he-ftnrd)", "https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/system/iot/2u/sys-211e-frdn2t)"], "section_summary": "The section discusses the architecture of a 5G Telco network and how Supermicro servers are used as key components in the Rakuten Symphony solution.

The smart and flexible work order arrangement and optimized resources are the key factors for smart manufacturing. The process data from controllers are an important reference for the operation of the production equipment like OEE, running hours, alarm history for the risk of availability even the predictive maintenance information. These data combining the working orders can help the smart manufacturing system/management level analyze the optimized production plan and resources arrangement for both the manpower resource and the production equipment. For the basic function, factory operations can have more data to track and identify the failure process data from the production history when the operator is running product inspection procedures to filter the specific failure pattern of the product. Combining the data from work orders and the controller in machinery, we can have a complete track list for \u201cwhen,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d \u201cwhich machine or production line,\u201d \u201cwhat is the production recipe setting the record,\u201d and so on.

For advanced smart production, this is the concept of \u201cSmart Manufacturing\u201d for Industry 4.0. It is a new type of manufacturing. This is because, by analyzing the relationship between failure process data and failure pattern, operations can have the database to predict which failure process data will cause the specific product failure.

With SAP HANA projects, customers are deeply reviewing their current infrastructure and its transformation to a more innovative solution such as hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) recently Supermicro has certified by SAP for production systems. Hyperconverged infrastructure brings compute, storage, and the hypervisor together into a single system, which reduces data center complexity and increases scalability to break through all obstacles of conventional architecture, especially SAN and NAS storage, including their networking. HCI is a software-defined infrastructure model that delivers performance, reduces network overhead, and mainly comes with a simpler IT management and supports dynamic growth by adding all needed resources by merely adding one additional HCI node. With the certification of SAP HANA on hyperconverged infrastructure powered by VMware vSAN, Supermicro\u2019s customers can bring down their data center TCO by leveraging our best of breed systems. Benefits of SAP HANA on VMware vSAN 2 SOLUTION This document describes Supermicro\u2019s HCI Solution Supermicro PowerBlocks powered by VMware vSphere & vSAN for SAP HANA on the Ultra SuperServer 6029U-E1CR4T and 2029U-E1CRT. These systems are designed for large in-memory computing and mission-critical enterprise applications in density optimized 2U chassis. Those servers support enterprises that require the highest operational efficiency and maximum performance.

The system is optimized to transport and remove the heat from today\u2019s most powerful AI servers. Supermicro is pioneering a way to obtain a complete AI solution, from the servers to the cooling infrastructure. Supermicro Liquid Cooling Tower Solution Summary Worldwide, the amount of energy that data centers consume is increasing yearly. A significant portion of this is to cool the servers and storage systems. With the increased use of servers dedicated to AI training, traditional air cooling costs are skyrocketing, requiring liquid cooling to be considered. In fact, liquid cooling may be the only viable technology moving forward with the current trajectory of increasing TDP at the server and rack level. The ability of forced air systems to remove the heat generated in the entire data center requires significant investments in computer room air conditioning infrastructure, significantly increasing the TCO of a data center. Liquid cooling is significantly more efficient at the data center level and requires an entire solution to cool the systems. The Supermicro green computing total solution now includes a state-of-the-art integrated liquid cooling tower as part of the overall infrastructure. The Supermicro Liquid Cooling Tower solution is versatile and energy efficient at removing the heat produced by today\u2019s latest servers.

Imagine a use case where a private cloud serves multiple tenants whose workloads peak at different times of the year. The overall cluster load remains relatively constant, with VM resource allocation varying depending on which tenant workload is peaking. The hypervisor on each node must therefore choose the best resource allocation scheme to maximize the performance of all VMs in the node. However, having five tiles on four nodes causes per-node load fluctuations and requires inter-node load balancing to maintain good performance. Confining all five tiles to three nodes at the start of the test severely impacts performance without efficient load balancing. Figure 4 graphs the Supermicro FDR performance2. There are 60 VMs with load levels that vary by as much as 16x every 12 minutes. These VMs resided on three nodes when the test began. VMware DRS was enabled after 12 minutes, and some VMs migrated to the fourth node. DRS continued to migrate VMs throughout the two-hour run to maintain load balancing. Supermicro\u2019s testing shows that: \u2022 The 12-minute moving throughput average deviated from the reported throughput by as much as 7.5%. \u2022 The maximum deviation of the 1-hour moving average was only 1.2%. These results demonstrate the efficiency of the VMware ESXi scheduler and VMware DRS. 5 Figure 4 - tpsHCI throughput during the ramp-up period and two-hour measurement interval Recovery From a Lost Node The TPCx-HCI Data Accessibility test requires the cluster to continue processing after a node suffers an immediate, ungraceful shutdown.

VMware vSAN 7 Standard Edition was key to this rapid recovery 3. 6 Figure 5 \u2013 Transactions continue with slight performance loss following a node failure Benchmark Implementation TPCx-HCI is similar to other virtualization benchmarks in that it uses a tile-based architecture, where each tile is a unit of configuration and load distribution replication. A TPCx-HCI tile has 12 VMs with different characteristics. A tile consists of four groups, where each has one Tier A VM and two transaction-specific Tier B VMs, as shown in Figure 64. Figure 6 - Architectural layout of the driver and SUT 7 In the published report5, the driver consists of 650 customer emulator threads (VCEs) and 200 market exchange emulators threads (VMEEs). The SUT consists of nine tiles. VM1 of each group contains that group\u2019s Tier A, which runs the business logic application (database front end). VM2 is the Tier B VM that holds the DSS database and accepts the two storage-intensive DSS transactions. VM3 is the Tier B VM that holds the OLTP database and accepts the nine CPU-intensive OLTP transactions. The four groups have the same architecture but different load levels. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 contribute an average of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the tile's total throughput over the two-hour measurement interval. Each group\u2019s load varies over the measurement interval, as shown in a run time of the benchmark, as shown in Figure 3 above.

Supermicro SYS-2029P-TXRT Inference Application Optimized Server - Supermicro MAX IO 3 - In order to show Supermicro MAX IO and NVIDIA inferencing servers are a perfect match. We use perf_ client benchmark tool to run some inferencing benchmark upon NVIDIA NGC inferencing server with the following setup. The following data is running based on ResNet-50 model with input image size as 224*224 three channels, more information please refer to reference1. Final result Image per second on Y-axis is calculated by multiplying Inferences/second and batch size. Testing results show that even when MAX IO is populated with up to 8 pieces of T4, inference server can get nearly linear Inferencing scalability on ResNet-50 with different batch sizes including 8, 16 and 32. With 8 T4 populated in MAX IO from slot 0 to slot 7, we have 6 out of 8 T4 running in PCI-E x8 bandwidth. However, inferencing benchmark result on ResNet50 with small to medium batch sizes shows that we can fully utilized T4\u2019s computing power without being capped by PCI-E x8 bandwidths.

Object Storage Solution Architecture Overview Cluster Reference Configuration Explain Quantum ActiveScale Object Storage Architecture provides a system that can maximize storage availability and scale the system with minimal to no impact on the customer experience and performance by implementing a 2-layer architecture combined with advanced next-gen shared nothing storage techniques The Access Layer is responsible for providing a single global namespace across the entire environment. Client applications talk to the Object Storage system through the Access Layer using the S3 protocol. The Access Layer executes client facing functions like authentication, authorization, encryption. It also houses a scalable object metadata database, protected by having multiple copies across the access servers. The Storage Layer is where all object data is stored in a very reliable fashion. While there is only one instance of the access layer in a single system, there might be multiple instances of the storage layer called Columns. A single object is stored in a single column. Dynamic Data Placement allows the system to directly store the objects on available disk and storage nodes, ensuring reliability and availability. No rebalance is required when scaling up the Column. Dynamic Data Repair will provide all drives upon detection of a failed drive, and the missing data can be repaired to any available drive in the system.

Each AI developer can quickly spin up a virtual machine with the GPU resource he/she would need. The developer modifies the AI model, trains it with different data batches, and then tests AI inference. The developer can use one virtual machine or multiple VMs. Multiple developers can do their development independently of each other\u2019s, as NVIDIA vCS would allocate system and GPU resources as needed. When the AI model is trained and incorporated into the end application and ready for deployment, NVIDIA vCS can also be used to operate and scale the AI application one or more virtual machines, with allocated GPU resources to run the AI inference. Multi-Tenancy could also be supported using vCS and the underlying virtualization hypervisor.

As convenient as it might be, it did come with serious risks. In case of problems with an element from one supplier, it was impossible to replace selected network elements. Due to the lack of interoperability with devices from other suppliers, the entire solution had to be replaced with enormous costs as Radio Access Network is the most expensive part of the mobile network. Not to mention the high pricing in general as a result of virtually no competition on the market. It was clear that changing a model was a matter of time. Also, to build a 5G network offering the quality parameters underlying the 5G standardization, the density of the base stations\u2019 grid should be significantly increased while reducing their power. However, densifying the network in the traditional silo model is impossible, as it will be too expensive. Moving to open systems The Open RAN concept is based on open and standardized interfaces, which grant interoperability. Thus, it enables multiple vendors to provide different parts of hardware and software. Although various network elements come from numerous vendors and are proprietary, they are designed to work together with other vendors\u2019 products. In addition, open RAN is based on a software and hardware separation concept, enabling COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) servers to be used. This open model allows for significant savings, and on the other hand, it enables much more efficient use of available resources such as locations, computing devices, and frequency bands. The image explains the main differences between traditional RAN, vRAN, and Open RAN. According to Dell\u2019Oro research, Open RAN will account for 15% of the overall 2G-5G RAN market by 2026. They also estimate that the Open RAN sector is supposed to generate $15 billion in revenues between 2020 and 2025 globally. Also, the share of mobile networks built in the open model will grow in the following years.

Introduction to Redis on Flash Redis on Flash increases the capacity of a Redis cluster by utilizing high performance Flash memory as a storage tier below main memory (RAM). All keys are stored in RAM along with the hottest values. Cooler values are migrated to Flash. When a value stored in Flash is accessed, it is promoted back into RAM. More details about the internal operation of Redis- of-Flash can be found at redis-enterprise-flash-database-architecture. / Introduction to Redis On Flash 1 The Influence of Flash on Cluster Design 2 CSD 2000 in the U.2 Form Factor 3 Redis on Flash Hardware Configuration and Results 4 Conclusion 17 As a global leader in high performance, high efficiency server technology and innovation, we develop and provide end-to-end green computing solutions to the data center, cloud computing, enterprise IT, big data, HPC, and embedded markets. Our Building Block Solutions approach allows us to provide a broad range of SKUs, and enables us to build and deliver application-optimized solutions based upon your requirements. 2 The Supermicro X12 FatTwin architecture provides flexibility and system accessibility for unique data center requirements. Unique one-half width nodes provide two nodes per rack unit, allowing for maximum reliability for modularized left and right nodes with redundant power supplies. These highly modular multi-node systems feature a tool-less design, and each node supports dual 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors for improved performance. Redis on Flash utilizes RocksDB to manage the values stored in Flash. RocksDB employs a Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) structure that makes insertions into the database very fast, but reads may require multiple storage access to retrieve a record. RocksDB is therefore ideally suited for write-heavy workloads.

A typical Redis on Flash system will write frequently to Flash but read only occasionally. The data access pattern strongly influences the performance of a Redis on Flash deployment. A very high temporal locality of reference allows most values to be served from RAM, while random access patterns stress the Flash storage layer more. The higher the Flash to RAM ratio, the more dominant the Flash storage layer becomes to database performance. A practical recommendation is to maintain a 10:1 ratio of Flash to RAM, but the ideal ratio will depend on the workload and the goals of the Redis on Flash deployment. This document introduces a reference design that combines the ScaleFlux CSD 2000 solid-state storage drive and the Supermicro X12 FatTwin platform to deliver a high performance, low TCO platform that is uniquely suited to Redis on Flash deployments. Using a test cluster populated with reference design nodes, the performance under extreme workload corner conditions and real-world access patterns is evaluated to understand how the introduction of a Flash storage layer affects Redis performance. The Influence of Flash on Cluster Design Considerations The Flash storage layer in a Redis on Flash deployment resides on solid-state disks (SSDs). Due to the latency-sensitive demands of a Redis database, data center SSDs are preferable to hard disk drives. Also, the PCI-E interface will be faster than legacy SAS or SATA interfaces to the storage device. Modern datacenter grade SSDs are offered in capacities typically ranging from 2TB to 16TB, with average capacity increasing as Flash density continues to scale. At a 10:1 ratio of Flash to RAM, few SSDs per node are required in a Redis on Flash deployment. For example, a system with 1TB of RAM may deploy 10TB of Flash storage. The small number of SSDs needed for a Redis on Flash deployment leads to several important design considerations: 1. The SSDs must individually offer very high endurance with excellent mixed workload performance since the workload will not be spread out among a large quantity of SSDs. 2. The server platform does not need to provide a large quantity of drive bays, which enables high-density solutions. 3.

The increased database capacity concentrates the number of shards per node, favoring the latest generation processors with higher core counts.

The append-only log, ephemeral data, and the RocksDB database all target mount points on the CSD 2000 RAID 0 array, which was formatted with an ext4 operating system. Note that the Linux page cache uses any free unused RAM to avoid disk access. Memory that is not used by Redis (or other host processes) will be mainly used to cache data managed by RocksDB. This improves the RAM hit rate for data stored in the Flash tier. Initial Database Population The database was populated with 6 billion records with a value size of 512 bytes. This object size creates a relatively large index that consumes over 60% of the available RAM reserved for Redis. This object size was chosen to place the most stress on the Flash storage layer (i.e., ensure the workload maximizes the random read IO demands on the Flash storage layer).

Corner Case Analysis Since RAM is both higher throughput and lower latency than the Flash storage tier, the highest performance will be achieved when a workload can be served primarily from RAM. Conversely, a workload that maximizes access to the Flash storage tier will determine the lowest performance. By characterizing 100% read (GET), 100% write (SET), and 70%/30% mixed read/write (GET/SET) workloads with both maximum RAM access and maximum Flash access (corner case analysis), the performance boundary conditions can be determined. GET - Maximum RAM Hit Ratio The RAM hit ratio can be driven to 100% by accessing a span of the keyspace that can fit entirely into memory. Once the main memory cache tier is hot (all accessed values have been promoted into RAM), the read performance that the test cluster can achieve reaches a maximum.

This remarkably large band accommodates 40% of access, reaching the Flash storage tier with a high latency consistency. As the hit ratio decreases below 60%, the Flash layer becomes saturated. As the hit ratio exceeds 90%, performance becomes increasingly RAM dominated; however, note that while there are gains in the number of operations per second, the average latency is not significantly improved compared to hit ratios down to 60%. A Closer Look at Flash Throughput Figure 13 shows the instantaneous read throughput collected over a three-minute interval at three different sigma levels. 16 Figure 13 - Flash Read Throughput over Time The read workload from Flash is relatively steady. At the lowest RAM hit ratio tested (\u03c3 = 10% of the key range), the read throughput peaks to the maximum limit provided by the RAID0 array (6GiB/s). The write workload to Flash is much more mixed. It consists of persistence data, ephemeral data, and the RocksDB workload. Persistence data is flushed every second and produces a baseline workload. This can be most easily observed in the case where \u03c3 = 0.5 of the key range. On the other hand, the RocksDB workload is characterized by periodic bursts corresponding to table flushing from RAM (see Figure 14). Figure 14 - Flash Write Throughput over Time 17 Flash Endurance Flash devices are rated for a total amount of write activity (or endurance) expressed in either drive writes per day (DWPD) or in total bytes written (TBW). With the write heavy workload of RocksDB, it is essential to characterize the Flash storage layer's performance and its expected life.

Consumers have increasing tools to create and share information, leading to data growth numbers that can hardly be comprehended. Businesses are doing their fair share to add to this mountain of data, hoping it can be leveraged to provide massive value as business intelligence.

In fact, with many gaming IPs having grown to become a ubiquitous part of pop culture, and the creative IPs from video games now seen in the same vein as original novels or movies, the boundaries between target user groups have all been removed. Similar to how past technology breakthroughs shaped the way we collectively interact with content today, cloud gaming is the technological revolution within the cross-media entertainment landscape which will open up gaming content to all existing media platforms. Cross-Media Cloud-Gaming Solution 1. Benefits of adding cloud gaming to existing media platforms Interactive entertainment and Game streaming, in particular, have been identified as \u201cthe next big thing\u201d in revenue growth, Newzoo forecasted that over 30 million paying users spent a combined $2.4 billion on cloud gaming services in 2022,1 with expected revenues to grow to $8.2 billion by 2025. SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand) platforms are investing in movies and TV shows based on gaming IPs in a bid to attract and retain new gaming centric users and, in some cases, even directly publishing games based on popular internal IPs. Gen Z consumers spend an average of just over 12 hours per week on video games2, surpassing TV by approximately half an hour. The only media platform that accounts for higher hours per week is social media. The difference between Gen Z and other consumers in terms of time spent with video games and virtual worlds is not so stark, suggesting that every generation is leaning toward the more immersive platform, especially as more types of entertainment are getting folded in. 1 2 As a global leader in high performance, high efficiency data center technology and innovation, we develop and provide end-to-end green computing solutions to the data center, cloud computing, enterprise IT, big data, HPC, and embedded markets.

For content distributors, like ISPs, device manufacturers, OTT services, and Media companies, Cloud Gaming is an opportunity to provide their subscribers with interactive features and access to a whole new media catalog previously locked away behind a hardware wall. By providing additional content verticals to a single content platform, users\u2019 fidelity and time spent within the platform will be increased. For the Gaming Industry and game publishers, this is an opportunity to have a whole new population of gamers discover, or re-discover, games based around an IP or universe they might not have known existed or were unable to previously access because of the prerequisite hardware needed to run them. 2. Driving usage and user engagement with cross media experience. The expansive metadata dataset available through the Blacknut API enables the close integration of game IPs and universes with existing media ecosystems and recommendations algorithms. Linking video games with media leverages the continuous growth in casual gamers with the universe or content they might be fond of. For content distributors, like ISPs, device manufacturers, OTT services, and Media companies, an all-in-one media ecosystem encourages the cross-pollination of users between cloud gaming and traditional media catalogs of relevant shows and movies. Users can switch between forms of entertainment seamlessly without leaving their platform of choice. As cross-media works both ways, video and gaming content can be advertised to subscribers, surfacing content they might be unaware of and incentivizing them to remain within the ecosystem.

Ansys Fluent and Ansys Mechanical applications running on Supermicro systems enable fast development of these products. Supermicro workstations and servers supporting the AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO CPU (single socket) run Ansys applications in a shorter time but at two-thirds the power consumption of dual processor systems. As a result, these are ideal solutions for mission-critical Ansys Fluent simulation for enterprises and SMBs alike. This explains the performance and power savings for Ansys software running on a Supermicro workstation and the Supermicro 2U-2Node server. 1 Benefits of Single CPU Systems 2 Performance Results 2 Test Scenarios and Performance Settings 6 Ansys Fluent and Mechanical Software 6 AMD Threadripper PRO CPU 7 Supermicro Workstation 7 Supermicro 2U-2Node Server 8 Conclusion and References 8 2 2 In addition to supporting the high-performance AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO CPUs, the Supermicro workstation and Supermicro 2U-2Node server also support GPU options to enhance Ansys software operations. Whether for individual users or as scalable data center compute clusters, Supermicro workstations and the Supermicro 2U-2Node server systems provide the performance and energy savings that can address the demands of high-performance Ansys Fluent, Mechanical, and other software in the Ansys offering. Benefits of Single CPU in a System The Supermicro workstation and the Supermicro 2U-2Node system support a single AMD CPU in the system. Since the AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO delivers up to 64-core in a single CPU, the system performance rivals dual-CPU systems. These systems offer the latest two generations of AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO processors: 3995WX and 5995WX for 64-core systems. Other AMD CPUs for single-socket systems are also supported. Performance Results Below are the performance results of the Ansys Fluent and Ansys Mechanical benchmarks for two generations of the AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO CPU running in the Supermicro workstation. For each CPU, the benchmarks were run with 32 active CPU cores (processes) and 64 active CPU cores (processes).

With its built- in acceleration capabilities, this new processor offers an improved performance that can help boost application performance, productivity, and efficiency across various applications. What is OpenSSL? OpenSSL is an open-source software library that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols and provides a full-length general-purpose cryptography library. Therefore, anyone interested in securing the communication between clients and servers may benefit from using OpenSSL to benchmark performance. What is Intel QuickAssist Technology? Intel QuickAssist Technology (Intel QAT) is an acceleration engine that significantly increases the performance and efficiency of standard platform solutions in the cloud, networking, big data, and storage by providing a framework for accelerators supporting software and hardware offload of popular cryptography, hash public key and compression/decompression algorithms. As a result, applications utilizing Intel QAT will see significantly reduced CPU utilization and greatly increased performance for encryption, secure client tunnels, and/or secure storage compression. Intel Quick Assist Technology has been expanded to provide software-based acceleration of cryptographic operations through instructions in the Intel Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel AVX-512) family. This software-based acceleration has been incorporated into the Intel QAT Engine for OpenSSL. This dynamically loadable module uses the OpenSSL framework, allowing administrators to add this capability to OpenSSL without having to rebuild or replace their existing OpenSSL libraries. When combined, Intel QuickAssist Technology and OpenSSL work together to provide fast and more secure encryption and decryption performance.

Supermicro and Intel ran OpenSSL Speed performance testing on a Supermicro X12 GrandTwin system showing performance gains when Intel QuickAssist Technology software engine is enabled. These results demonstrate that organizations can benefit from increased performance and enhanced security for their encryption and decryption operations when Intel\u2019s technology is used on a highly versatile Supermicro platform. Testing Environment In the Supermicro\u2019s test lab, engineers ran an OpenSSL Speed test on the Supermicro SYS-210GT-HNTF GrandTwin system. The platform used an Intel Xeon Scalable 6312U processor running at 2.4 GHz, 512GB DDR4 memory, 480GB SSD, and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system. In addition, both Hyper-Threading and Turbo Boost were enabled. 3 Test Results: Supermicro achieved significant performance gains in the tests by enabling the Intel QuickAssist Technology engine. Improvements up to 33.23x were observed compared to our baseline across all the tests. The most substantial performance gains were observed in more secure algorithms, which tend to be more compute intensive. The increased performance of these algorithms over less secure ones can be quite significant. For example, our baseline, non- QAT test for ECDSA p384 (384 bit) achieved 1,253.4 signs/sec. However, when we enabled the Intel QAT software engine, the performance increased drastically, achieving 41,649.7 signs/sec, which is 33.23x more than the baseline. Similarly, ECDH p384 baseline achieved 1,317 ops/sec, then 17,752.6 ops/sec with Intel QAT software engine enabled, a 13.48x performance improvement over the baseline test.

Object Storage Solution Architecture Overview Figure 1 \u2013 ActiveScale Object Storage Architecture Cluster Reference Configuration Explained Quantum ActiveScale Object Storage Software Architecture provides a software environment that can maximize storage availability and scale the system with minimal to no impact on the customer experience and performance. ActiveScale software provides a scale-out architecture that allows the environment to grow and expand by adding additional Supermicro servers. The ActiveScale software resident on each server in the cluster cooperates with all other instances of software for a seamless, single system environment and single global namespace. The software is composed of an Access Layer and a Storage Layer. The Access Layer coordinates a single global namespace across the entire environment. Client applications talk to the Object Storage system through using the S3 protocol. The Access Layer executes client facing functions like authentication, authorization, and encryption. It also houses a scalable object metadata database, protected by having multiple copies distributed across each server in the cluster.

As the organizations' requirements expand and transform, the Supermicro X13 BigTwin can effortlessly accommodate these changes, making scalability a smooth and worry-free experience and allowing you to integrate new technologies seamlessly without interruptions. In our Proof of Concept, Supermicro proud to spotlight the 2U 2-Node configuration, which optimally balances storage capacity and cost-effectiveness performance. The target configuration was a vSAN-ESA-AF-6 ready node with 40TB of storage capacity per node. This result was achieved by populating 7 out of 12 drive bays in the front. This configuration demonstrates the best minimum configuration for ESA-AF-6 for the best performance per dollar. However, if it is still needed to scale the infrastructure, the Supermicro X13 BigTwin 2U 2-Node can potentially be a high-density vSAN-ready node with 12x drives per node and 3x PCI-E Gen5 slots for networking. The Supermicro X13 BigTwin empowers organizations with the flexibility to accommodate any configuration in their existing HCI infrastructure. As a high-density vSAN-ready node, the Supermicro X13 BigTwin\u2019s 2U 2-Node configuration supports any workload with the most demanding storage and networking requirements. Whether you are pursuing to enhance your storage capacity, network connectivity, or overall performance, the Supermicro X13 BigTwin is an ideal solution with efficiency and adaptability for vSAN ESA environments. 3 Solution Lab Architecture Test Configuration SYS-221BT-DNTR Type SMC PN Description Node QTY System Qty System SYS-221BT-DNTR X13DET-B, CSE-217BD2-R2K22P, SCC- P12N12SGH-B2 2 CPU P4X-SPR6448Y- SRMGN-MCC SPR 6448Y 2P 32C 2.1G225W(24/2.6/225,16/2.9/205)60M", "start_char_idx": 4177, "end_char_idx": 5916, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47b9d4eb-5a6d-455d-8652-c681019511f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "47b9d4eb-5a6d-455d-8652-c681019511f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Solution-Brief_VMware_vSAN_BigTwin_HCI.pdf", "publication_date": "August 2023", "referenced_websites": ["https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/system/bigtwin/2u/sys-221bt-dntr", "https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/2u/2029/SYS-2029BT-HNC0R.cfm", "www.supermicro.com"], "section_summary": "The section provides an overview of SuperMicro's BigTwin HCI solution, which is a 2U 4-node system designed for high-performance computing and data storage.

Figure 3 - Weka Performance Overview 5 Supermicro WEKAIO Reference Architecture Supermicro Server Overview AS -2114S-WN24RT Note: additional PCIe4 slots can be exchanged for 4 NVME connect (2 max) Case Study: Biomedical and Life Sciences Research The data center infrastructure team's key focus at biomedical research centers is supporting high-performance computing (HPC) for general bioinformatics work. One very common workflow is Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS) analysis using the GATK pipeline for sequence alignment and variant calling. However, the HPC cluster has also to support numerous research jobs running simultaneously with unique toolsets. The data center infrastructure team's challenge is to architect a system for scientists with growing informatics needs for their research: more compute, more storage, faster storage, and \"bigger\" data. The team typically manages the data from high throughput lab instruments, such as NGS and Electron Microscopy. (EM) They support mixed workloads that can vary greatly, ranging from jobs with a few very large files (100s GB), to jobs with many very large files, to jobs with thousands of tiny (< 1MB) files, and jobs doing lots of meta operations. Existing storage architectures based on decades-old technologies used to meet the needs of capacity and were never a significant bottleneck to productivity when software stacks were not well developed. But with the increase in workload size, complexity, and throughput and the maturing of analysis workflows (highly-tuned CPUs and the emergence of GPUs), the legacy storage system can no longer keep pace with the growing performance demands. For the \"hot\" active data tier, researchers demand faster storage to handle mixed workloads and a cost-efficient object storage back-end solution to manage larger capacity.

In addition, the turn-around time is better because the jobs finish faster and the results get to the scientist quicker, which accelerates the next stage of their research. The research workflows are greatly simplified because using Weka eliminates the complexity of staging data in and out of a compute node's local SSD. Research outcomes are no longer limited by how much data can be stored on a compute node's local SSD, and with WekaFS acting as a front-end, they have faster and easier access to their object archive tier, ensuring the applications have access to all the data. Ultimately, researchers now have so much performance and expandable capacity available to all nodes that nobody has to think about storage any longer, enabling a greater focus on outcomes of their research. For one customer, they had the following results: \u2022 Faster Time to Answer: research jobs were reduced 10X; one job was reduced from 70 days to 7 days; another typical analysis workflow was reduced from 12 hours to 2 hours. \u2022 Multiple Concurrent Projects: researchers supported 3x the number of simultaneous new research initiatives, all while having faster turn-around time and job completion times.

For several decades these approaches were sufficient to maintain average levels of overall equipment efficiency (OEE); however, this is no longer the case, as costly limitations often accompany these approaches. On one end, equipment would either be over or under-maintained when relying on scheduled maintenance. While on the other end, reactive maintenance significantly increases the chance of unplanned downtime and safety risks. Both scenarios result in the inefficient use of resources while negatively impacting overall operational efficiency. To overcome these costly limitations, the industry has started shifting towards a predictive maintenance approach, which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to optimize OEE.

Although AI and ML-based predictive maintenance technologies show great promise, it is not always easy to implement as they require certain prerequisites. Challenges of AI Application Deployment in Manufacturing Deploying AI-based predictive maintenance in this industry presents specific challenges that must be overcome to ensure successful implementation. Some of these include: \u2022 Limited Historical Data: AI models typically rely on substantial amounts of historical data for training. Usually, a subject matter expert and data scientist would be needed to analyze and develop an algorithm to train the AI model based on available historical data. \u2022 Data Complexity & Interpretability: In some cases, critical machine information may not have been captured in the past due to equipment or process changes, making it difficult to establish reliable patterns for accurate predictions. \u2022 Real-time Processing & Latency: Significant computational power and time are likely required, which can introduce latency that can impact other performances. \u2022 Complex System Integration: Manufacturing operations have a complex ecosystem of interconnected systems. This will require careful planning and implementation to ensure compatibility and seamless data exchanges between new applications and existing infrastructure. \u2022 Appropriate Edge Hardware Requirements: Edge devices with sufficient processing power to execute AI workloads while being robust in design to withstand rugged environments.

Additionally, local compute resources are essential in situations requiring near real-time data processing and response. Most solutions that include inferencing need to be updated frequently (or at least more frequently than traditional applications) because of changing environments, advances in state-of-the-art, and models that no longer perform the way they did when first deployed (model drift). This requirement drives the need to be able to remotely deploy, manage and monitor edge solutions that include an inferencing component. Another unique aspect of these inferencing workloads is that they often run on heterogeneous computing platforms (GPUs, NPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs), and the infrastructure needs to be able to orchestrate, monitor and monitor these different computing devices. In addition, a significant use case for Edge Computing is called Secure Access Service Edge (SASE). SASE is a architectural model that combines network and security-as-a-service functions together and delivers them as a single service.

All the features of a cloud are available out of the box: high availability, load balancing, storage replication, software-defined networks, scripting, and API access. Businesses can significantly lower costs by reducing the need for IT expertise or physical intervention. \u2022 Simplified Scalability: NodeWeaver adapts itself to the available hardware, so it is possible to create clusters with heterogeneous hardware without needing to adapt or configure anything. Live swapping means you can replace a faulty system with any available system: no need to be restricted to identical hardware forever. Users can mix hardware within a cluster of nodes or even replace a specific node with new hardware, and the system automatically recognizes the processor, memory, and storage and optimizes/rebalances the cluster to meet the needs of the applications. The extremely lightweight footprint of the NodeWeaver platform \u2013 requiring only one physical core and 1 GB of memory - means that you can select the optimal hardware for your use case without wasting resources.

The original video must be encoded or compressed to reduce the size of Raw video files. Also, to match the viewers' devices, the stream must be decoded or converted to a supported resolution, frame rate, video codec, and network bandwidth. This process is referred to as video transcoding, which minimizes bandwidth and delivery infrastructure usage. Video transcoding is a core technique for streaming because it affects the streaming service for both the service provider and the users. The video service provider must decide how to transcode video content into multiple representations and store them, which further increases the operational cost of the service provider. Since video transcoding is computation-intensive and consumes considerable resources, it will significantly affect the service provider's operating cost. Media Delivery Architecture and Workflow To provide viewers with high-quality video content in real-time so much goes on behind the scenes. Media processing and delivery comprise three essential processes: video capture, video transcoding, and streaming delivery. Video content is initially captured and stored with a particular format, spatial resolution, frame rate, and bit rate. Then, the video is uploaded to streaming servers. Next, a streaming server must transcode the original video based on the client's network bandwidth, device resolution, frame rate, and video codec. Finally, video streams are distributed via CDNs server to end devices. Figure 1 - Video Transcoding Workflow Figure 2 \u2013 Media Delivery Architecture and Workflow 3 The Challenges of Media Delivery Rapid technological and network advances are improving content delivery but, at the same time, drastically increasing the streaming throughput.

Codecs are essential in delivering the best video quality while ensuring a smooth playback experience. Accordingly, a video streaming infrastructure requires leveraging the most advanced and new codecs, such as AV1, VP9, and HEVC. New codecs allow service providers to deliver the same video quality with a smaller bitrate. However, these codecs are more compute-intensive than H264. With hundreds of millions of videos being uploaded by users every day, it would be prohibitively expensive for service providers to use CPU-only transcoding for all AV1 and HEVC videos. So, compute costs must be added as another dimension of an optimized and cost-effective solution. New hardware and technologies are demanded to support new streaming requirements. In addition to the above challenges, HEVC and h264 codecs include many patent-protected video compression techniques.

AVC, HEVC, and VP9 codecs are also supported along with AV1. It is possible to access these codecs using standard frameworks such as FFmpeg or Gstreamer, or with oneVPL, which allows access to more controls and parameters. With these encoders, providers can adjust TCO-related parameters based on performance/quality presets. Optimized Platform with Supermicro and Intel To meet subscriber demands for more sophisticated content, media processing and delivery providers must optimize their TCO. Supermicro and the Intel Flex Series GPU support that purpose by increasing the density of streams supported per server without compromising quality. Supermicro is first-to-market with solutions for Intel Data Center GPU Flex Series, so early testing for workload has been possible. Following Intel's guidelines, video streams with 1080p and 4K resolutions were benchmarked using FFmpeg. Further, using optimized Intel presets for video transcoding, H.264, HEVC, and AV1 codecs were tested. 7 As a result, a single Intel Flex Series 140 GPU can support as many as eight simultaneous 4Kp60 or 36 1080p60 streams per card. The accelerator provides this exceptional performance while keeping its power below 70 watts. The partnership between Supermicro and Intel allows for a range of configurations. For example, populating SYS-the 420GP-TNR systems with ten cards, 80 4Kp60 or 360 1080p60 streams can be delivered. More configurations are available for different Supermicro systems, giving service providers the right choice and allowing them to reduce their data center footprints and expenses associated with equipment and facilities.

To store these large file sets, companies have typically used heterogeneous storage platforms from multiple vendors\u2014cloud, NAS, distributed, or parallel file systems\u2014which contributes to data sprawl and adds management complexity. As a result, many organizations are turning to next-generation software-defined storage platforms to consolidate into a single namespace and simplify management. However, migrating unstructured file data between these disparate storage platforms is complex and risky. Solutions such as rsync or Robocopy are not scalable, require many time-consuming checks, and can lead to data loss. Organizations require a cost-effective migration solution that can quickly and reliability move hundreds of millions or billions of files from existing storage to these next-gen platforms. Atempo\u2019s Miria, built on Supermicro SuperServers, offers a high-performance, scalable, multi-platform solution for migrating petabytes of unstructured file data with millions/billions of folders and files.

We attribute this to the fact that our rack assembly team stocks an inventory of parts and can start assembly of a rack cabinet of systems immediately upon receiving an order. Rather than customers waiting and stock-piling many components until everything arrives, Supermicro can begin assembly quickly and ship the final product to customers in a single box. Supermicro Plug and Play (PnP) solution can save money and accelerate the time-to-market approach for timely deployment. 5 Industry Standard Components Supermicro builds the entire Rack Scale solution. That means we audit all hardware components, including 3rd party components, to give confidence that a completely tested and standardized total solution. Evaluating factors such as processing power, memory capacity, network connectivity options, storage capacity, and reliability ensures that the selected hardware meets the specific needs of the rack integration project. It\u2019s all guaranteed to work right after delivery. Energy Efficiency Supermicro can adapt our rack solutions to whatever power configuration our customers have. The manufacturing facility supports 208, 230, 415, or 480VAC. Single or Three Phase, and the facility is 48VDC-ready. Most importantly, though, the rack scale solutions are energy efficient. Supermicro significantly reduces energy consumption through more efficient power supplies in our products, liquid cooling capabilities, and even immersion cooling. Supermicro considers factors such as power consumption, heat dissipation, cooling capacity, and available space for IT solutions. For example, determining proper ventilation requires assessing components' heat output and airflow patterns and implementing appropriate cooling mechanisms to prevent overheating and ensure efficient cooling throughout the rack.

Built on industry standard Redfish APIs and open source Rack Scale Design software framework from Intel, Supermicro RSD runs on Supermicro server/storage/switch hardware offerings and maximizes utilization through disaggregating compute, network and storage resources distributed within a rack or across multiple racks. Supermicro Rack Scale Design (Supermicro RSD) 2 BENEFITS OF RSD Supermicro RSD offers data center operators the following benefits: 1. Open REST API based Management Provides Interoperability and Scalability in Cloud Scale Infrastructure In today\u2019s large data center environments with tens of thousands of servers distributed in hundreds of racks, traditional 1-to-1 server management using IPMI is inadequate to meet the extensive provisioning and management requirements. Designed with the whole rack as the new management unit in mind, Supermicro RSD leverages an open RESTful API called Redfish that is designed to support composable infrastructure to provide functionality beyond what can be achieved with IPMI. Redfish API provides secure hardware management at rack scale and enables interoperability among potential RSD offerings from different vendors. Acting as a south-bound API for the underlying hardware and a north-bound API for plugging into existing application environments such as OpenStack, Redfish API is the glue of RSD framework.

Locality: Many of these domains and use cases require very low latency for interactive use. With the ability to quickly move this system with the combination of fast CPUs with multiple CPUs and a graphics accelerator, latencies are kept to a minimum. They do not involve relatively slow networking from an information worker's office. Although the hardware could be installed in a data center, the latencies to the users' screen would involve the transmission of graphics data over the network (VDI), which would not allow the combination of AI algorithms and display applications to work together. Locating the development system where the human is situated increases productivity for AI-based applications that require fast response times with minimal latencies. Noise: The Liquid Cooled AI development platform reduces noise significantly. Compared to a data center, work areas are expected to have reduced noise, with the SYS-751GE-TNRT-NV1 AI development platform putting out about 30 dB when idle, 40dB when running at a 50% CPU load, and 50dB at a 100% load. The key is to utilize a self-contained liquid cooling system, where the CPUs and GPUs are all liquid cooled. Mobility: Unlike a server in a data center, the SYS-751GE-TNRT-NV1 can move from one office to another. When a department's need changes, a powerful AI computing system can be easily redeployed with a simple connection to the network. If the AI development server needs to be placed in a centralized computing facility, the system can be easily mounted in a data center rack. This system is designed to be located in an office, cubicle, or at home due to noise levels of about 30dB and standard office electrical power requirements. 3 3 NVIDIA AI Enterprise Development Platform Summary NVIDIA AI Enterprise is a complete set of AI software that allows developers and organizations to become more productive faster.

Cold plates can be set up to work in parallel. Pumps \u2013 the liquid must be moved around in the system, from the reservoir to the cold plates to the radiator and back to the reservoir. Hoses \u2013 Proper hose length and diameter are critical to the efficiency of a liquid-cooled development system. Radiator \u2013 the heat from the CPUs and GPUs must be removed from the liquid. The simplest way to do this is using a simple radiator, where the warm liquid enters at the top of the radiator, and room temperature air is circulated over the liquid, reducing the temperature of the liquid as it exits the device.

AMD EPYC 74F3 Processors Deliver Superior Performance on Transactional Processing Workloads with Oracle Database 19c Supermicro AS -1014S-WTRT Server This benchmark ran Oracle Database 19c on a high density single-socket Supermicro AS -1014S-WTRT server powered by AMD EPYC 7F72 and AMD EPYC 74F3 processors, as shown in Table 1. The high core density of AMD EPYC processors makes the Supermicro AS-1014S-WTRT an ideal, compact (1U, 25.6\u201d 4 deep), and cost-effective solution for database processing and enterprise application workloads. Customers may choose AMD EPYC 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 core, and P variant CPU SKUs that offer unique pricing benefits compared to dual-socket-capable AMD CPUs. The benchmarking process selected a single-socket system because it offers a unique and robust value proposition capable of predictable workload performance scaling and because 3rd Gen AMD EPYC cores can consolidate workloads that previously required dual- or multi-socket systems into a single-socket scale-up server.

Oracle Processor Licensing is available for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and is calculated by multiplying each processor's total number of cores by the appropriate licensing factor in the Oracle Processor Core Factor Table. Oracle also charges an additional support fee. This license model allows customers to reduce license costs by selecting low-core CPUs with high frequencies, such as the AMD EPYC 74F3. Oracle Database Standard Edition licensing uses a per-socket license model that requires an individual license for each socket. A processor is counted as equivalent to a socket; however, in the case of multi- chip modules, each chip in the multi-chip module is counted as one occupied socket. The single-socket Supermicro AS-1014S-WTRT is, therefore, an ideal cost-optimized solution for small to mid-size Oracle Database deployments. Conclusion The single-socket Supermicro AS-1014S-WTRT is an ideal cost-optimized solution for small to mid-size Oracle Database deployments.

Workflows kicked off rendering jobs over lunch or at the end-of-day for overnight runs, followed by changes and more rendering. This 1:1 coupling between designer and workstation has limited scalability and made remote work difficult. NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise changes the 3D design scalability and remote work equation. It enables collaboration for creative teams on enterprise 3D visualization projects like never before. This new technology reduces costs and waste by enabling a simultaneous workflow, maximizes creativity by allowing new iterations without opportunity cost, and accelerates time to production by eliminating import-export workflows. Highlights of the Omniverse architecture: \u2022 Rendering builds on advanced NVIDIA RTX accelerated real-time ray-tracing technology and adds dynamic allocation of graphics processing unit (GPU) cores, even from separate machines, for rendering jobs. \u2022 Collaborative scene composition is enabled by Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD), an extensible, open- source file framework that allows the interchange of 3D assets. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse Nucleus database and collaboration engine manage data such as geometry, lights, materials, textures, and more for defining a virtual \"world\" in and around a design, including its environment. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse Connect allows 3rd party client applications access to the Nucleus database using publish- subscribe messaging, letting many designers author live changes that everyone connected sees in real-time. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse Kit is a toolkit for lightweight plugins building applications and microservices. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse Create enables world-building, using advanced USD workflows such as layers, variants, instancing, animation caches, and more. \u2022 NVIDIA Omniverse View lets non-technical users review 3D content interactively in full, photorealistic fidelity. Using Supermicro hardware platforms, 3D design teams can select a hardware topology and mix and match configurations for an Omniverse Enterprise solution best fitting their needs. For example, \"creators\" can tap into the full capability needed for design, while \"reviewers\" can run on lighter hardware platforms at a reduced software licensing cost.

As a result, most industries are undergoing a shift in how they think about data management at the edge. This is further underscored by Gartner analysts who estimate that by 2022, more than half of all enterprise data will be processed outside of the datacenter. Enterprises understand that more compute technology will need to be deployed closer to the edge data sources to reduce latency in processing this remote data. This shift to edge computing will heavily rely on the deployment of devices such as IoT gateways and industrial PCs.

In the past, technology at the store level was primarily focused on improving store operations with backend systems such as inventory management and supply chain, PoS, and security/loss prevention. However, there is an opportunity for retailers to combine their physical presence with innovative technologies to create unique and valuable experiences for their customers. Organizations that will adopt technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, analytics, and digital signage will be able to deliver immersive experiences, better services, and greater efficiencies for consumers. The foundation of these new capabilities is a technology platform that is flexible to adapt to new applications, simple to deploy and manage, autonomous at any scale, optimized and cost-compatible with the retail edge.

Increased resilience The private network becomes more robust to disruptions by distributing computing power and tasks among multiple edge devices. In case of a problem when an edge device is facing an error, the workload may be smoothly transferred to another edge device, maintaining continued operations and minimizing network downtime. Edge computing's redundancy gives an extra layer of stability to Private 5G/LTE networks, increasing system availability. Enhanced scalability and flexibility Supermicro\u2019s advanced edge computing capabilities enable effective scalability of the private network managed through the Neutroon Cloud Platform when the number of connected RAN devices increases. Enterprises may quickly deploy more edge devices to manage the increasing computing load, assuring maximum performance and responsiveness. Additionally, Supermicro allows for greater flexibility in deploying new edge applications to serve multiple use cases of the clients, as edge devices may process data locally without requiring significant modifications to the cloud-based architecture. These new use cases can be tested thanks to the unification of edge computing and private 5G/LTE since unparalleled flexibility is achieved by minimizing connectivity firewalls and bottlenecks. Improved data privacy and security In the case of Private 5G/LTE networks, Supermicro\u2019s edge computing solutions optimize data privacy and security.

With bi-directional throughput of up to 2 TB/s, these engines play a critical role in the inter-processor communication needed during the training process. This native integration of RoCE allows customers to use the same scaling technology, both inside the server and rack (scale-up) and across racks (scale-out). These can be connected directly between Gaudi processors or through any number of standard Ethernet switches. With high compute utilization for GEMM and convolutions, low-power system design, and Bfloat16 support enabling FP32 accuracy with 16bit training speed, the Supermicro X12 Gaudi AI Training System is built to prioritize two key real-world considerations: training an AI model as fast as possible and reducing the cost of training. The system enables high-efficiency AI model training for vision applications such as manufacturing defects, resulting in better products with fewer warranty issues and fraud detection, saving billions of dollars annually. Inventory management is another area that benefits from AI technologies by allowing enterprises to become more efficient. Using AI technologies, medical imaging becomes more accurate and faster at detecting abnormalities, and identification from photos or videos can enhance security where needed.

According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, ships carry 80%1 of global trade volume, including food and farm products, fuel, forest products, iron and steel, clothing, shoes, electronics, toys, and cars. This makes ports a crucial connection to supply chains around the world. The importance of maritime ports makes them a constant target of cyber criminals and hackers that want to steal goods or disrupt operations. The impact of a significant successful attack could be immense; insurance provider Lloyds reports that a single cyber-attack on ports in Asia could cost $110 billion2.

Zscaler helps eliminate that risk. Server maintenance and ongoing patches and updates are critical components of securing the system. The Rafay KOP for Edge product is designed for the comprehensive and secure provision of software from a central control point. The software running on the computer systems can be maintained in an automated fashion using the Rafay platform. Since a port is a location that has many moving parts and can cover a very large footprint, it is not reasonable to house IoT systems in a controlled data center environment with standard off-the-shelf rack mount servers. As a result, the computers required to support these devices and use cases must be designed for rugged environments and have the compute resources to support high demand processes. The Supermicro SuperServer platforms using the Intel Xeon processors are designed for such deployments. Additionally, these systems can be deployed in hardened cases that reside throughout the port to ensure reliable processing of ConScan data.

Industry-known tools and GUI are used for each stage of the pipeline, optimizing the data scientists' experience and eliminating the learning curve for new tools/GUI. \u2022 cnvrg.io improves the scalability of your AI infrastructure. cnvrg.io makes the coordination of resources easier to manage and effectively pools your infrastructure into a more consumable manner. \u2022 While cnvrg.io offers one-click development and deployment of ML pipelines to Supermicro Servers, it can also auto- detect the lack of resources and burst your workload to the cloud of your choice. \u2022 Unlike other platforms, each stage of the pipeline can be attached to a different resource, including the support of multi-cluster and heterogeneous compute pipelines. \u2022 cnvrg.io will support the environment of your choice, be it Kubernetes, bare-metal, or any hypervisor (e.g., KVM. All can co-exist within your Supermicro clusters. Key Features: Heterogeneous Compute Pipelines: Launch and manage end-to-end heterogeneous ML pipelines where each component or stage (in a single pipeline) can run on a different compute architecture optimized for the specific use-case: preprocessing and/or inferencing on CPU, deep learning training on GPUs, and inference in the edge. MLOps Utilization Dashboard: Improve visibility across all ML runs. cnvrg.io dashboards have been proven to increase infrastructure utilization by up to 80% with advanced resource management. cnvrg.io gives data engineers and IT the tools to monitor utilization, properly size the compute components and visualize who uses what, with extensive cluster utilization visualization.

This makes the management and deployment of racks of servers much more manageable. Supermicro, Cloudera, & NVIDIA Accelerate Enterprise Data Analytics 8 Supermicro Server Cluster running Cloudera Data Platform Private Cloud Base and Spark 3.x The starting base Cloudera Data Platform Private Cloud Base has 10 Ultra servers (either 1U or 2U). Many more servers can be added to scale the cluster depending on the amount of data and computing needed. There are options for high availability and data storage. To accelerate Spark Apache 3.x operations, we can add Supermicro Ultra servers with NVIDIA A30 or NVIDIA A100. The Cloudera cluster automatically incorporates additional servers to scale the cluster performance. Supermicro is providing a reference architecture for this cluster in a separate document. Conclusion In collaboration with Cloudera and NVIDIA, Supermicro is delivering high performance server clusters supporting GPUs to provide enterprise level support to customers to turn their data into valuable insights to run their business. The GPU acceleration provides five times and more speedup over CPU operations for Apache Spark 3.x jobs. The CPU-based servers support the other Cloudera streaming, security, governance, and storage functions. Supermicro's SuperCloud Composer monitors the server hardware operations to provide high availability. SCC also deploys the appropriate operating systems to the servers in the cluster, while Cloudera offers a simplified means to deploy the Cloudera applications. Together, Supermicro, NVIDIA, and Cloudera deliver high performance clusters to process customer data into valuable insights to run their business. The entire solution comes with enterprise level support.
